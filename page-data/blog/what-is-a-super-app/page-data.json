It’s one\napp for media sharing, social media, movie bookings (the irony?), taxi-hailing,\npayments, video calls, commerce and more. It also has its own Slack-like\ncorporate account. Hell, even government agencies use WeChat.\n\nUsers check the app at least 10 times a day on an average, and more than 80% of\nusers purchase products online. That kind of stickiness at such scale is\nunprecedented.\n\nIt’s not really an app as much as an Operating System for smartphones. WeChat is\na Super App.\n\nWhat makes for a Super App?\nIn 2010 [http://devblog.blackberry.com/2010/02/what-is-a-super-app/], Mike\nLazaridis, the Founder of Blackberry, took a stab at what a ‘Super App’\nconstitutes, “…representing a new class of mobile applications that make you\nwonder how you ever lived without them.” Lazaridis’ definition was a closed\necosystem of “many apps” that people would use everyday “…because they offer\nsuch a seamless, integrated, contextualised and efficient experience”.\nBlackberry, as you know, got unbundled because they charged the user to be on a\n‘platform’, without adding services to the platform. By building a walled\ngarden, the brand alienated its users.\n\nA Super App is many apps within an umbrella app. It’s an OS that unbundles the\ntyranny of apps. It’s the portal to the Internet for a mobile-first generation.\n\nMore often than not, it will likely be operate at the intersection of\nlogistics/hyper-local delivery, commerce, payments and social. To become a Super\nApp, you need at least two of these functions. The idea is to scale fast once\nyou have a user’s buy-in, and add multiple services to gain loyalty.\n\nOnce you have direct offerings, the next logical step is to open the app up to\nthird-party companies to build on a loyal user base. Now, you don’t build\nseparate apps. Instead, you can host your offerings on a single Super App.\nStep-by-step, the Super App becomes the OS.\n\nIn that context, there are a rare few who have what it takes to build a new-age,\nmobile-first OS that can be categorised as a Super App.\n\nSay hi to GOJEK*.\n\nWhat makes Gojek a Super App\nGojek is one app for ordering food, commuting, digital payments, shopping,\nhyper-local delivery, getting a massage, and two dozen services. It’s\nIndonesia’s first and fastest growing unicorn, building an on-demand empire.\nGojek runs the equivalent of three Indian unicorns rolled into one.\n\nMeet... the #SuperAppWith more than 125+ million app downloads, and total order\nvolumes growing 6600x in 36 months, Gojek already has 18+ products. Every year,\nthe company adds more ammunition to its arsenal. It’s the only hyper-growth\nstartup in the world from a developing country. One app, many use cases. Gojek\nis a #SuperApp.\n\nBut why a #SuperApp?\nBy removing clutter from a smartphone OS and its multiple apps, UX acts as a\nbait to get the next billion on a smartphone. Design becomes a language for the\nuninitiated. But among a dozen reasons why, here’s the most hilarious one:\n\nRemember India’s ‘Good Morning’ message phenomenon? Every day, India’s mobile\nusers send a ‘good morning’ image to their friends and family. According to a\nWSJ report\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-internet-is-filling-up-because-indians-are-sending-millions-of-good-morning-texts-1516640068]\n, “These images have an overabundance of sun-dappled flowers, adorable toddlers,\nbirds and sunsets sent along with a cheery message.” As a result, one in three\nsmartphone users ran out of space daily, according to a Western Digital report.\n\nAnd the first thing they do to free up space is… delete apps.\n\nBut it’s not about space constraints anymore (that’s a thing of the past) — it’s\nabout breaking design language barriers so more baby boomers and the next\nbillion users can participate in the Internet economy.\n\nIn a nation of 1.3+ billion people, a little over a third of India has access to\nthe internet.\n\nIndia ranks well below the global average for mobile connectivity in the world.\nMobile broadband connectivity is only slightly better than Kenya.\n\nA Statista report\n[https://www.statista.com/statistics/276623/number-of-apps-available-in-leading-app-stores/] \nshows there are over four million apps available between just the Google Play\nstore and the Apple App Store, and the glut is painful for countries with\nlimited smartphone memory and a saturated market. A Super App corrects this\nimbalance. It sits on top of a mobile OS by shrinking the time taken to complete\na specific task and in turn, increase productivity. For the next billion users,\nit also adds UX elements that make it easier for users to get accustomed to\nmobile phone usage.\n\nIs it easy? No. Ask Facebook. For about two years, Facebook’s Messenger tried to\nbuild the WeChat of the West without much success. It remains to be seen if they\ncan do it in the current climate.\n\nWhich also makes GOJEK an interesting study.\n\nThe big sell for Gojek\n> The biggest moat Gojek built is payments. Once you’re handling money for a user,\nyou can build a castle of services within it.\nGoPay is accepted at close to 300,000 online and offline merchants in Indonesia,\nand processes $6.3 billion of annualised Gross Transaction Value (GTV). Talk\nabout disruption…\n\nGojek is one of the most interesting stories coming out of Southeast Asia and\nalso one of the least understood ones.
