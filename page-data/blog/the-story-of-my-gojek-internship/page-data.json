As the Summer\nPlacements semester got going in full swing, I decided to pursue an internship\nin the Product Management domain.\n\nWhen someone asked me: “Which is your dream company?”, I was not sure. I\nrealised that although there were renowned names coming on campus, for some\nreason, I wanted something more exciting.\n\nAfter days of pondering, I decided to apply off campus. A list was compiled, and\nthe options trickled down to three: Google, LinkedIn and Gojek! Thankfully,\nGojek had a PM internship opening. I applied, interviews went well and I was\nextended an offer at the Bangalore office.\n\nChapter 1: Documentation\n1st April 2019\n\nI reached the office full of enthusiasm, ready to make a mark of my own. The\nwhole day went in different formalities and it was almost evening when I got to\nmeet my team. To my surprise, by the end of the day, I was part of all relevant\ncommunication channels, team drives and had clarity on what I would work on for\nthe next four weeks.\n\nI just loved the agility shown by my manager to enable me to embark on my\njourney. In the process, I also realised why my undergrad friends working at\nGojek used to say that if you love speed, this is the place to be.\n\nThe next few days were spent understanding the product, people, and culture. I\nwas surprised by the volume and quality of the documentation done at the\ncompany. For a company which prides itself in being one of the fastest growing\nstartups in the world, this kind of emphasis on documentation was something\nunheard of. And because of these hundreds of beautifully crafted documents, by\nthe end of the first week itself, I was participating in their BAU (Business As\nUsual) meetings. (How many interns can claim this? 😜)\n\nChapter 2: Reading\n15th April 2019\n\nI was no longer a newbie in the company. I was having 1:1s with different\nstakeholders, attending IPMs (Internal Planning Meetings), BAU meetings and\nworking tirelessly on my dedicated projects.\n\nDuring the course of these all, one day I reached out to my mentor for\nsuggestions on how to prioritise among different features. This was his\nresponse:\n\n> “Read Abhishek, Read. What differentiates a good Product Manager from an average\none is his/her willingness to learn, and reading is the first and most important\nstep there.”\nHe gave me different links to read, (37 to be precise) which ranged from Product\nPrioritization, Product Design, Product Critique, Design Heuristics and even the\nPsychology involved in product success. As I pored through them, I realised\nProduct Management is not as random as it seems from outside. In fact, it is a\nfine cocktail of art and science mixed in just the right proportion.\n\nChapter 3: Inclusion\n23rd April 2019\n\nBy this point, I had completed my first project, got positive feedback, and was\nabout to finish the second. In the meantime, being a part of so many BAU\nmeetings had boosted my confidence and now I was chipping in with suggestions.\n\nDuring one such meetings, I raised a point in contradiction to what the other\nteam was saying. I tried to explain my point of view but we were not able to\ncome to an agreement. When I came out, I realised that I should have dealt with\nthe situation differently. I went to my mentor and explained as much.\n\n> To this, he said: “Sometimes it’s not only about how you or your team is looking\nat things. You also have to look at what is the value proposition of other teams\ninvolved”\nThis was the second important lesson which I learnt: being a PM your job is to\nfirst bring everyone at the table to a common ground before pushing any agenda. \nWhether it is inter-team or intra-team, to get the job done, you have to bring\npeople to your side by understanding what they want and why they want it.\n\nChapter 4: Relevance\n30th April 2019\n\nI had just finished my second project when I met a senior engineer while passing\nthrough the pantry area. He asked how it’s going and what I was working on. I,\nwith full excitement, told him many ideas I came up with.\n\nAnd then he said: “Man, it doesn’t matter how cool the ideas are or how great\nthey sound. Judge them on their relevance. Are they correctly solving the\nproblem intended? Are they adding value to the lives of relevant stakeholders?”\nAnd then he gave me a set of 10 similar questions and said that if after\nanswering these 10 questions, you still believe you should implement the idea, \nthen it matters.\n\nChapter 5: Impact\n7th May 2019\n\nI had started understanding the nitty-gritty of product management and was\nraring to pick a more challenging project. And then I got this mail from my\nmanager:\n\nReally??? After such nice product & strategy based projects, this is what you\nwant me to do!!\n\n> But again, that was my inexperience talking.\nDuring the course of the next week, I learnt one more valuable lesson: “Look at\nthe impact of your work, not how cool it sounds. Being a PM, the world is your\ndomain and processes are as important as the product itself. If you want your\nproduct to succeed, you need to oil the whole machinery.”\n\nRecently, I came to know that a senior PM found the document to be super good\nand now it is being used across the substreams to onboard new hires. (I’m\nallowed one humblebrag right? 😅)\n\nChapter 6: Communication\n21st May 2019\n\nThe changing weather of Bangalore had hit me hard and I had to take a leave\nowing to ill health. I sent a message each to my manager and mentor regarding\nthe same. My mentor replied asking me to inform the whole team, which I missed\nand read quite late. When I did, I figured I am an intern anyway, and don’t have\nany current projects with the team. Even if I don’t send the mail to them, it\ndoesn’t matter much.\n\nWhen I met my mentor the next day, he asked why I didn’t send the mail, and I\nexplained why. He said: “Abhishek, it doesn’t matter whether you have a current\nproject with the team or not. Being a PM, one of the most important skills is\nbeing very clear in communication. There might be situations where you wouldn’t\neven know and people would be waiting for you. Not only in this case, but in\nevery everything you do, a PM needs to be a clear and careful communicator.”\n\nChapter 7: Ownership\n24th May 2019\n\nMy internship was nearing it’s end, and I reached out to my mentor for some\nsuggestions on the last project I was working on. During our conversation, he\nasked if my previous one had gone live in production. I said no, but clarified\nthat my part is done and it is stuck on other collaborating teams.\n\nThat’s when I realised I had one last lesson left to learn:\n\n> “Being a PM it’s your job to get it from conception to production. If there are\nblockers, you have to proactively reach out to remove them. Being a PM is a\ntricky job, once you have dirtied your hand, the onus comes on you to get it to\ncompletion.”\n> “Once you have picked up something — It’s All Yours.”\nEpilogue\nToday, when I look back, my internship at Gojek was a short, but sweet journey\nwhich taught me many lessons. As I go back for my second year at IIMA, I am much\nmore confident when it comes to Product Management.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSpecial thanks to my manager Vikrama Dhiman, my mentor Manas J Saloi, Shobhit\nSrivastava, and all the members of the Transport team who were always ready to\nhelp me during the course of my journey.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant more updates on how we build scalable systems for Southeast Asia’s\n#SuperApp?
