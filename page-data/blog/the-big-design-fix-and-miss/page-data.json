Wondering how we got here? \nHere’s the story so far: we were redesigning the checkout experience for Gojek’s\nfood delivery product — GoFood.\n\nWhy did we do a design change? Because nearly 20% of our customers abandoned\nfood in the cart at the ‘Checkout’ page. ?\n\nWhat’s the reason for that? There’s a dozen of them! Read the first piece in\nthis series for details on how we went about our research to understand users’\npain points.\n\n> Clearly, our original flow had issues. We had to change the structure to not\nonly support the complexity of the page, but also make it seem easier and\nintuitive to use.\nThis piece is about solutions. Our ephemeral moment of joy. ??\n\nOnce everyone understood the problems, it was time to point the team towards a\ncommon vision. We knew that the main issue sprung from the user needing to\nperform multiple actions and verifications — on a single page.\n\nTo illustrate, below are the five components chopped from our old checkout page\n(that required three scrolls to navigate through).\n\nNumerous iterations (in double digits if I had to recall the number), countless\npaper sketches, and feedback sessions followed. It took us another month to\nfinally find and roll out the solution. Safe to say we kept the proverbial\nmidnight oil burning.\n\nThe ideal solution, here we go.. ?\nAs described in the last post [http://bit.ly/2U8mm7s], we had identified five\ndistinct problems with our old Checkout flow that frustrated around 20% of users\nenough that they abandoned their order. For each one of the problems we\nidentified, we came up with a corresponding solution:\n\nSolution 1 — Simplify Information\n(Problem: Verbose Information)\n\nIt was time to be brutal and cut down on information density. We started off by\nasking a few questions:\n\nWhat goes with what? Do we really need this, or that? — This approach helped us\ngroup similar content and reduce visual complexity by combining or eliminating\ninformation altogether.\n\nHere’s an example. Our existing dish card consisted of the following components:\n\n * Dish Name\n * Dish Price\n * Stepper (number of dishes added)\n * Notes (added by the user)\n * Dish Description\n\nOur primary aim was to shrink the size of the card by removing or hiding\nredundant information and adding delight. It conjured up Maeda’s Principle of\nSimplicity — SHE. (Shrink, Hide, Embody).\n\nOur redesigned dish card was laid out like this:\n\n * Dish Name, Number (stepper) and Price: This is the minimum information a user\n   requires to confirm the dish in the cart to move forward. So we decided to\n   retain this as is.\n * Notes: There was a huge argument about this one — some said “let’s remove\n   notes entirely” while the others debated “ let’s do it at cart level rather\n   than having them per dish”. But our data said otherwise: 7 out of 10 dishes\n   ordered had notes added. This is very much a cultural nuance in Indonesia;\n   people order in groups and want their food customised to a point that\n   bewilders someone from the outside, like me. For example: while ordering the\n   traditional Padang — notes look like this: (1) ayam pop, rice with ayam pop\n   plus gulai soup plus rendang seasoning, no papaya leaves, more ayam pop\n   sauce, spicy pleaseeee, wrap it in one pack… because people there have\n   different preferences on the level of spiciness and packaging. Hence, we\n   decided to retain notes, but Hide it behind a 16 x 16 button which saved us\n   over a 100 pixels ?.\n\nThe redesigned notes section :)Dish Description: Technically users need the dish description before adding it\nto the cart (to get a sense of the taste, of course!). So, finding no use for it\nin the cart page, we considered removing it altogether. BUT, we didn’t want to\nbombard the user with too many changes in the redesign. Hence, we decided to S\nhrink and reveal only a portion of the description, retaining the rest behind a\nclick. (After a lot of trial and error, we decided on revealing 3 lines max —\nkeeping in mind various device sizes and our content quality).\n\n * Dish Images: Our conversion rates for dishes with images was way better than\n   dishes without images (6 out of 10 dishes ordered had images ??). To make\n   up for the missing notes and shrunken description, we took full advantage of\n   the saved real estate to bring in dish images on the checkout page, in order\n   to drive monetary growth (ordered dishes) and improve business metrics. Oh,\n   and obviously, add more delight for our users. ?Hence Embodying the dish\n   card.\n\nDish description redesigned :)We applied the same principle to payments, delivery, voucher & billing. \nObviously, we shifted through troves of data points for each of these ?. We\nmade a few radical changes, but without overwhelming the user.\n\nSolution 2 — Progressive Disclosure\n\n(Problem: Cognitive overload)\n\nOur aim here was for each component to be self evident, It was important to not\nonly simplify each section, but also reveal them in order of relevance. Rather\nthan throwing information at our users, we wanted to gracefully present it — to\nmaintain their attention by reducing clutter and confusion.\n\nThings that are related logically, are related visually.\n\nAfter a lot of arguments and brainstorming around user behaviour and device\nsizes, we locked down on the two-step checkout design — we divided the five\ncomponents from a single page into two different steps.\n\nThis was a huge shift in thinking, and was going to add an element of confusion\namong our loyal users. Instead of taking 100 actions on one page, our fall back\nwas to divide and conquer. A calculated leap of faith ?\n\nPage 1 — Check dishes, Cross selling & Total price (food-related information)\n\nPage 2 — How to pay and where to deliver (checkout-related information)\n\nThis improved usability by presenting only the minimum data required for the\ntask at hand. It also helped us achieve the following:\n\n * Bring down cognitive overload.\n * Ease decision making.\n * Free up real estate for business and monetisation (banners, up-selling).\n\nTwo-step checkout designSolution 3 — Bring down checkout time\n\n(Problem: Prolonged Checkout)\n\nWith a simplified structure of divided steps, our on-point hypothesis was: \nlesser time taken to checkout ⏳. However, a lot of us also argued that the extra\nstep might increase the time instead. So we double-checked our hypothesis with a\nquick usability test. Much to our relief, the two-step process showed positive\nsigns and was proved to be faster.\n\nclick-click over scroll-scroll-scroll-click.\n\nAnother small change that saved time was to make the CTA sticky on both the\nsteps, this saved users from scrolling all the way to the bottom to take the\nprimary action.\n\nSolution 4 — Reduce Cancellations\n(Problem: High Cancellations)\n\nOne big way to solve this was to bring our location card in focus, hence we\nfeatured it prominently at the top on the second step (refer to the image\nabove), and not hidden behind a scroll. This made it easy for the user to\nimmediately verify delivery location as soon as they landed on this page,\nreducing cancellations caused by an incorrect delivery address.\n\nSolution 5 — Ship delight\n(Problem: Lacks love)\n\nShipping delight was critical for GoFood. As a brand, we were known to be fun\nand colloquial — we wanted our designs to reflect this trait visually ❤️\n\nHere’s an example of how we did it:\n\nOur old designs used the native pop-up to throw an error every time a GoFood\nuser placed an order above our maximum distance limit (25 km). It needed some\nlove, as we were dealing with hungry (and sometimes, cranky) minds. We tried to\nmake this screen more fun and informative.\n\nWe gave our users an understanding of why we don’t do food delivery above 25 km,\nand added a delightful illustration that was relatable for people in Indonesia.\n\nThe above illustration depicts a very common (funny) occurrence on the streets\nof Indonesia. Ever tried asking for an address or direction there? Well, chances\nare, you will end up exactly where you started. Yeah, that happens a lot! ?\n\nSome more examples of sprinkling love ❤\n\n❤ Delight all the wayyyy ❤Designing for edge cases ?\n\nAnother important step (often forgotten by designers) under the redesign sparkle\nwas solving for edge cases. It helps us reinforce usability in our designs by\nensuring whatever the user is trying to do works.\n\n“Why can’t I place my food order? Why is the ORDER button disabled?”\n— From a user who added 3 pizzas to their shopping cart at around 8:45 pm and\nrevisited the cart at 9:30 pm to place the order.\n\nUnfortunately, the pizzeria shuts at 9 pm. But, there was no way for the user to\nknow that since she accessed the cart directly from the homepage. ?\n\nSolving for the maximum in the happy flow, we didn’t sweat on edge cases \ninitially, but now that we had fleshed out our designs, it was time to turn the\nspotlight on our beloved edge cases . This helped reduce drop offs due to\nuncertainty, and increase business by guiding the user through it.\n\nEdge Cases — The UnderdogsCollaborating with engineers ?‍?\n\nIt’s one thing to have solutions in static sketch files, and a whole different\nfeeling to see them in action. We provided the engineers with prototypes to help\nthem paint a better picture and make our solutions more believable. ?\n\nAnother efficient way we communicated design intent was to actually sit with\nengineers. We did frequent design QAs — this helped us execute the expected\nexperience and gave us the ultimate pleasure of seeing every working pixel\nmatching our sketches.\n\nReady to launch ?\nPHEW! DONE!!\n\nThe new design was finally ready to ship. We were super excited to hear what our\nusers thought and how much they like our new, redesigned Checkout flow. Pats on\nbacks for the amazing work, research, and collaboration.\n\nThis was our moment of truth. All the months of hard work summed up in this\n6-second GIF ?\n\n\nGoing to Beta ?\n\nBefore rolling out to our millions of users, as is practice, we launched a beta\nversion to about 50K users. This was a good size for us to understand how things\nwere shaping up, and if we needed to go back to the drawing board.\n\nThings seemed okay — not too good or bad, no major dropoffs, the conversion\ngraph looked stable. Just like any good redesign, we were giving time to our\nusers to adapt to the new change before we received the desired applause.\n\nInstead…\n\nRadio Silence.\n\nTwo days into the new designs\nThings were not looking good. We took an entire week to collect meaningful data.\nWe lost a few thousand orders at peak. ??\n\nThat was not normal, that was the definition of a colossal mess up… The results\nwere the stark opposite to what we had anticipated.\n\nBy changing the UX flow on GoFood to supposedly offer a better experience, we\nlost thousands of bookings. A minor miscalculation in the decisions we took\n(well, in hindsight, major) had broken the flow for our most loyal users, and\nannoyed them enough to look elsewhere to satiate their tummies.\n\nWhat happened?… What went wrong? ?\n\nRead about how we identified what went wrong, and the steps we took to fix\nthings — in the third and final part [http://bit.ly/2HvbreJ] of this series.","html":"<p>By Fatema Raja</p><p>You are reading part two of a three-part series.
