This is mostly\n                because modern search engines have matured to a point where they\n                can deliver high quality results even if the entered query is a\n                weak signal of the user’s intent. Even when weak, every query\n                still contains a piece of the user’s intent.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                In the case of GoFood, that piece is a fragment of our user’s\n                hunger-driven brain.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                In this post, we’ll discuss how we personalise the search\n                results we surface on GoFood, based on the information we have\n                about our users’ food preferences.\n              </p>\n\n              <h5 className=\"text-center text-md-left text-black mt-5 maison-bold font-lg\">\n                How Each of Us Differ\n              </h5>\n\n              <p className=\"mt-3 mb-5\">\n                Let’s look at two of our GoFood users who have started feeling\n                the pangs of hunger, and come online to check restaurants near\n                them.

The coefficients/weights of these factors can be\n                arrived at by experimenting with them and choosing weights that\n                seem to maximise the ordering conversions. But, in the case of\n                restaurant ranking in GoFood, we want to take into consideration\n                many factors when deciding relevance.

The relevance judgements are relative and only intent to\n                be monotonically increasing with increasing relevance .

Based on this, later we will predict the relevance\n                judgement level and sort restaurants in decreasing order of\n                predicted relevance score. This approach reduces learning to\n                rank problem to a regression problem.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Another approach was to solve it is a pairwise ranking problem,\n                wherein the ML model is trying to learn how to get the order of\n                a pair of restaurants correct i.e if Restaurant A is more\n                preferable to Restaurant B , the order (Restaurant A, Restaurant\n                B) is correct and the order (Restaurant B, Restaurant A) is\n                wrong.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                For an ML model to be learned, we need an objective function\n                that captures this pairwise ordering formulation . This is\n                called a loss function or error function in ML and is the\n                measure through which an ML model can assess how right or wrong\n                its decision was. In pairwise ranking , this should be a\n                function that becomes higher whenever the model misjudges a\n                preference order and becomes lower when it is right about the\n                preference order.\n              </p>\n              <p className=\"mb-0\">\n                The loss/error function C is explained below:\n              </p>\n              <img\n                src=\"../images/blog/algorithm.png\"\n                alt=\"Personalization\"\n                className=\"img-fluid img-responsive\"\n              />\n\n              <p>\n                When this function is minimised, the model is trying to predict\n                a score for each restaurant such that the ranking of the order\n                of the restaurants are close the relevance judgements the users\n                made.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                The pairwise formulation is a better approach here in comparison\n                to the point-wise approach as it is looking to get the order of\n                restaurants right and is not trying to estimate the relevance\n                score themselves whose values were assigned only as markers to\n                show how some restaurants were more preferred relative to\n                others.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                We used an implementation of the LambdaMART algorithm that\n                learns to predict relevance scores so as to minimise this\n                pairwise loss. You can think of this as a pursuit to find the\n                decision tree that takes in all the parameters of the restaurant\n                and gives out a score to the restaurant . This score should be\n                assigned in such a way as to make the pair orders right.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Once this model is trained, it can be used during search, as\n                explained in{\" \"}\n                <a\n                  target=\"_blank\"\n                  href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/how-the-gojek-butler-serves-a-gourmet-meal-to-our-users-4a161d83052a\"\n                >\n                  this\n                </a>{\" \"}\n                post.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Now let’s go back to our beloved customers — Mila and Husain.\n                The next time Mila or Husain looks for restaurants near them,\n                the search results they see will be according to their\n                preferences.
