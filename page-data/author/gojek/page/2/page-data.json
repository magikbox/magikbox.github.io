Nadiem, Andre and Kevin have been\nrunning the business together for a number of years, which will ensure that this\nleadership transition will run smoothly.\n\nNadiem’s news was communicated in an email to all Gojek staff that was sent\ntoday. In the email, he looked back on how the company has grown over the past\nnine years and also set out his hopes for the future of the business:\n\n“We started this company with nothing, other than a deep desire to change things\nfor the better. We saw that the streets of Jakarta were a mess and that there\nwas an informal community of ojek drivers who could easily act as a huge part of\nthe solution to that mess, if only they were organised and working efficiently.\n\n“With just that initial desire to improve life for everyone, as well as a large\namount of support from countless friends, partners and stakeholders, we’ve\ncreated Gojek. An iconic company that flies the flag for the future of Indonesia\nand Southeast Asia.\n\n“I will leave Gojek in the capable hands of Andre Soelistyo and Kevin Aluwi as\nco-CEOs, both of whom have played central roles in moving the company along its\npath from that office in South Jakarta onto the global stage.\n\n“We got very lucky as we progressed along that path, but I believe that luck in\nbusiness only really becomes a valuable commodity if you have the brilliant\nminds needed to take advantage of it. Kevin and Andre have mentored me to be the\nleader I am today. They are quite simply Gojek’s best. They have been running\nthis company for a number of years and I have complete faith not just in their\ntechnical skills and ability to execute flawlessly, but also in their integrity\nand their desire to do the right thing every step of the way.\n\n“High emotions are involved in running a company like Gojek but Andre and Kevin\nare always the steady voices of reason, approaching problems with intelligence\nand compassion. I couldn’t ask for better successors as the Gojek movement\nbegins its next stage of growth.”\n\nA joint statement released by Andre and Kevin said: “When a friend and mentor\nleaves a business you have built together, there is always going to be some\nsadness, but we are both determined that Gojek will go from strength to\nstrength. We will continue to implement our vision as we focus on what the Gojek\nof the next ten years is going to be like.\n\n“This company has changed the lives of so many people in Indonesia and around\nthe region, and our key priority is to ensure that we can continue to act as a\npositive force in society for the foreseeable future.”\n\nUnder Andre and Kevin’s management, Gojek has grown exponentially, to process\nover two billion transactions a year. The company’s fundraising efforts have\nattracted some of the world’s most exciting companies including Google, Tencent,\nMitsubishi, Visa, AIA and Astra, with Series F set to raise well over US$2bn.\nThe company has also launched operations in Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam,\nwhile the Gojek app has become the most-used on-demand application in Indonesia,\nwhere its food and payments businesses have overtaken transport to become the\nlargest businesses within the group.\n\nWith the new structure, Andre will focus on corporate functions and management\nof capital allocation, international expansion as well as the payments and\nfinancial services businesses, while Kevin will focus on the product development\nelements of the Gojek business as well as marketing, organisational development\nand the transportation and food delivery businesses.\n\nSince co-founding Gojek, Kevin has held significant leadership roles across\nproduct and functional teams within the organisation.

Let’s take music as an example. It\nhelps to know the theory and to understand the mechanics of your instrument. It\nalso helps to have talent. Having a good partner to watch your back doesn’t hurt\neither. But there’s more to it.\n\nWhy are The Beatles [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles], who formed in\nLiverpool in 1960, considered one of the greatest bands in history\n[https://www.quora.com/Why-are-The-Beatles-the-greatest-band-in-history/answer/Giliana-P-Garc%C3%ADa-Acevedo-1]\n? Why doesn’t everyone else achieve the same level of success?\n\n> The difference between master and beginner is the amount of practice.\nThe Beatles applied the fundamentals they learned over and over again, using\nfeedback to get better every time. All told, they performed for 270 nights in\njust over a year-and-a-half. By the time they had their first taste of success\nin 1964, they had performed live an estimated 1,200 times. Most bands today\ndon’t perform that much in their entire career.\n\nThe 10,000 Hours rule\nIn the early 1990s, psychologist K. Anders Ericsson and two of his colleagues at\nBerlin’s elite Academy of Music conducted a study\n[http://projects.ict.usc.edu/itw/gel/EricssonDeliberatePracticePR93.PDF]. With\nthe help of the Academy, they interviewed twelve expert pianists (8 men and 4\nwomen) and 12 amateurs (7 men and 5 women).\n\nThe amateurs never practiced more than about three hours a week over the course\nof their childhood, and by the age of twenty, they had totaled two thousand\nhours of practice. The experts, on the other hand, steadily increased their\npractice time every year, until by the age of twenty, they had reached ten\nthousand hours.\n\n> “To become a chess grandmaster also seems to take about ten years. (Only the\nlegendary Bobby Fisher got to that elite level in less than that amount of time:\nit took him nine years.) And what’s ten years? Well, it’s roughly how long it\ntakes to put in ten thousand hours of hard practice. Ten thousand hours is the\nmagic number of greatness.”\n> Malcolm Gladwell, in his book “Outliers: The Story of Success\n[http://amzn.to/wgo1hw]”\nThe interesting thing about that number, of course, is that ten thousand hours\nis an enormous amount of time. It’s all but impossible to reach that number all\nby yourself by the time you’re a young adult. This would require encouraging\nparents and some measure of wealth, which would avoid the need to hold down\nadditional jobs that would eat into valuable practice time.\n\nWhat Happens in the Software Industry\nIn the software industry, we take developers trained in theory and throw them\nstraight into the deep-end, working on a project with no real precedent to draw\nfrom. It’s like taking a group of kids to fight against the big gang in the\ntown. But that is not an issue because, in software engineering, we do our\npracticing on the job, and that’s why we make mistakes on the job. But at the\nend of the day, we want to be great while still managing the objectives. For\nthat purpose, we need to find ways of splitting the practice from the\nprofession. A practice method that is effective and without taking up too much\ntime.\n\n> This is where CodeKata comes in.\nThe CodeKata\nKata [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata] is an exercise in Karate to execute a\nspecified series of a variety of moves, with stepping and turning, while\nattempting to maintain perfect form. It teaches the student about proper form\nand position to helped them visualize different scenarios for each motion and\ntechnique. Traditionally, kata is taught in stages. Previously learned kata are\nrepeated to show better technique or power as a student acquires knowledge and\nexperience. It is common for students to repeat every kata they have learned but\nat an improved level of quality.\n\nSandy Vs. SpongebobCodeKata is an attempt to bring this element of practice to software\ndevelopment. The intent behind CodeKata is similar to Karate Kata. Each is a\nshort exercise. It repeated multiple times, adding little improvements in each\ncycle. Some involve programming and can be coded in many different ways. Some\ninvolve thinking about the issues behind programming and design. These are\nunlikely to have a single correct answer.\n\n> Remember that the point of the kata is not arriving at the correct answer. The\npoint is the stuff you learn along the way. The goal is the practice, not the\nsolution.\nHow Is This Accomplished at Gojek?\nAt Gojek, there’s a program for employees called Engineering Bootcamp\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/what-is-the-go-jek-engineering-bootcamp-de7778836da9]\n. Basically, it is weeks of intense hands-on learning designed to unlearn and\nequip skills needed to be a world-class engineer.\n\nCore Engineering BootcampAt Bootcamp, the way coaches taught us (participants)\nis similar to CodeKata. We have a code drill session in the afternoon to solve\none problem by using Java. After the class ends, we solve the same problem again\nas homework in the evening using Ruby. There are many things we did in our code\ndrill session, that really helped us develop in CodeKata. Those are:\n\n1. Set Rules\nWe have rules called Non-Negotiable Etiquette. If you violate one of the rules,\nyou have to rm -rf your code and start it again from scratch. What is rm -rf? It\nis a basic command on Unix system to remove files or directories from the\nmachine forever.\n\nNon Negotiable Etiquette\nIf you violate one, rm -rf! never love your code </3\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.  Indentation and spacing between code constructs (classes/methods/specs)\n     must be consistent.\n 2.  Use only spaces (no tabs) for indentation.\n 3.  Newlines at end of file.\n 4.  Follow accepted naming conventions for your language/framework.\n 5.  Follow accepted naming file and Directory structure for your\n     language/framework.\n 6.  Use namespaces.\n 7.  No comments/Unused Code/Unused file/Unused folder must ever be checked in.\n 8.  Runtime environment should be consistent with IDE environment -  i.e there\n     should be no difference in running a build or a spec from your IDE and from\n     the command line.\n 9.  Use .gitignore.\n 10. Ensure there is a README.md that includes problem description, dev\n     environment setup, build instructions, and run instructions.\n 11. Test Driven Development (this should show in clear pattern in the commit\n     log - one spec, one code change per commit)\n\nCan you imagine the feeling when code that we wrote with blood and tears needs\nto be deleted for one small mistake? Is that acceptable?\n\n> Yes, you must not love your code.\nThat small mistake is not tolerable in production and even development. It could\ncause bugs, errors or other things that may become a bottleneck. But of course,\nwe don’t rm -rf in work 😂. It’s just a practice so that we don’t get overly\nattached to the code, remain careful about mistakes, and most importantly —\nmaintain quality.\n\n2. Practise Pair Programming\nAs the name implies, pair programming is where two developers work on one\nmachine. We only have a keyboard and a mouse for each pair. One developer acts\nas the driver who codes while the other serves as the observer who checks the\ncode being written, proofreads and spell-checks, and also figures out where to\ngo next. These roles can be switched at any time: the driver will then become\nthe observer and vice versa.\n\nPair Programming greatly helps us in CodeKata, because:\n\n * It’s harder to procrastinate. Working as a team means you can’t stop and\n   check your email, Slack, Facebook or WhatsApp every few minutes.\n * When someone shares a problem you are going through, you feel less defeated\n   and more positive about trying again.\n * Increases software quality without impacting much on time to deliver. It will\n   cost only 15% of the development time according to this study\n   [https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2001/09/20/agility-counts].\n   But with increased quality comes big savings later in the project.\n\n3. Have a Short Cycle\nThe point of CodeKata is to get experience from practice. In order to achieve\nthat, we solve the same problem multiple times. We try different approaches and\nsolutions to experience each advantage and disadvantage. While we work on it, we\nalso try to add little improvements for every cycle. But sometimes, we can also\ntreat the cycle as an iteration of solving the problem.\n\nBecause CodeKata is a practicing method and not project development. It’s not\nsupposed to be worked on for the long run. For that reason, we only have 20–30\nmins for every cycle (sometimes even shorter).\n\nAfter the Mini Retro, we showcase our code to other participants in the class.\nWhy do we need to do it? Even though the whole class is working on the same\nproblem, we may interpret it differently and have hundreds of possible different\nsolutions. Doing a showcase will tell others about progress and approaches. It\nwill trigger a discussion and synchronize the context for everyone. At the end\nof the day, we will converge at the current best solution.\n\n> It’s similar to Agile Development. You deliver something to the customer as soon\nas possible to get feedback faster.\nA Few Final Thoughts\nMy tips for CodeKata are:\n\n * Find a place and time where you won’t be interrupted.\n * Focus on the essential elements of the Kata.\n * Remember to look for feedback for every major decision\n * If it helps, keep a journal of your progress\n * Have discussion groups with other developers, but try to have completed the\n   kata first\n\nCore Engineering BootcampThank you for reading this blog!

They help us validate our hypotheses without\nhaving to involve our entire user base. However, any good experiment first\nrequires the answer to the question — how do we know the right number of people\nto include in it?\n\nLet’s break down why this is important. If we target too few, our experiments\nwill not detect smaller effects, leading us to miss legitimate opportunities. If\nwe target too many, we would be wasting resources and potentially hurting our\nbusiness metrics (if the treatments turn out to be detrimental).\n\nPreviously, we used simple heuristics (and a mysterious formula) to estimate the\nrequired sample size. These practices were not very scientific and produced\ninconsistent experimental results. To compensate, we had to repeat the same\nexperiment multiple times just to validate the results. Sometimes different\niterations would conflict with each other, leaving everyone scratching their\nheads.\n\nLast year, we ditched those unscientific practices and built a new tool called\nSample Size Calculator (yes, imaginative name, we know). This post explains how\nthe calculator helps us find the right number of people to include in\nexperiments.\n\nOur calculator is based on Frequentist school of statistics. Under the hood, we\nused both the pwr\n[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pwr/vignettes/pwr-vignette.html] \npackage and the base sample size calculation functions in R programming\nlanguage. This is what the tool looks like:\n\nFigure 1. Screenshot of the Sample Size Calculator used at GojekThe most\nimportant parameters are the type of dependent variable measured, the historical\ndata, and the required sensitivity from the experiment. As you can see in the\ngraph, if we increase sensitivity to allow detection of smaller effects, the\nrequired sample size soars, which makes sense.\n\nAlthough this is a major step in the right direction, there is a problem if we\nare interested in a continuous dependent variable for our experiment. This is\nbecause the underlying methodology used in the calculator assumes a normal\ndistribution, while most continuous metrics that we care about at Gojek — such\nas bookings per user — are usually skewed. By ‘skewed’, we mean that most users\nare light users and only a small percentage are heavy users. This could cause\nthe computed sample size requirement to be wrong because a key assumption was\nnot met.\n\nWe have four options to deal with this problem:\n\n 1. Use a methodology that doesn’t assume normality. Unfortunately, the\n    available non-parametric methods are complex to implement [1\n    [http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~ejohnson/regression/Sample%20Size%20Power%20Considerations.pdf]\n    ] [2 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4423589/]]\n 2. Transform data to have a normal distribution. This doesn’t always work —\n    some data just can’t be coerced to normal\n 3. Use a larger sample size. Since the worry is lower power than expected,\n    simple multiplication should boost the power, but the multiplier needs to be\n    reasonable. Figuring the right multiplier would be another beast on its own\n 4. Ignore it. This is the path we took\n\n> But but but… that’s not scientific!\nDon’t worry. We tested the robustness of this solution before going ahead with\nit.\n\nAs you can see in the graph below, we created two right-skewed distributions\nwith known 5% difference in means to serve as our populations. The plan is to\ncontinuously sample from this population (equivalent to replicating the same\nexperiment many times) and see how often we can detect this 5% difference (aka\nwhat is our “power [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(statistics)]”).\n\nFigure 2. Two right-skewed distributions (typical shape for continuous metric at\nGojek) with known mean difference (lift) of 5%The first step is to calculate the\nrequired sample size with a power of 80% and minimum detectable effect of 5%.\nLet’s refer to this sample size requirement as the “exact” size. Then we divide\nand multiply it by three and call them “less” and “more”, respectively. For each\nsample size, we sample from the populations, compute the mean difference\n(typically called “lift”), and repeat this procedure many times.\n\nThe resulting distributions of lifts are shown below. The coloured vertical\nlines show the average lift of each experimental size, which is also equal to\nthe actual population lift. This is central limit theorem\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem] at work. What is\ninteresting are the relative shapes of the sampling distributions. The “more”\ngroup is the safest and most consistent but the “exact” group seems to have good\naccuracy with only a third of the sample size. In the “less” group, we even see\na non-negligible number of lifts that are negative, even though we know the\npopulation lift is actually +5%. This is in line with our intuition that larger\nsample size is generally more trustworthy than a smaller one, all else being\nequal.\n\nFigure 3. Sampling distribution of the mean difference from each size groupSince\nwe currently report the statistical significance of our experimental results at\nGojek, we will also run t-test for each of our sample here.\n\nAs it turns out, 80.4% of the experiments in the “exact” group have\nstatistically significant results (p < 0.05), which is almost equal to the 80%\npower we set in the sample size calculator. In layman’s terms, the tool roughly\npromised that if you run the experiment with this sample size, you have 80%\nchance of detecting a 5% lift (the minimum detectable effect) if it’s there.\n\nSince it kept its promise even on non-normally distributed data, we can conclude\nthat the methodology is robust to some degree of violation of the normality\nassumption. Therefore we can ignore it until otherwise proven.\n\nFigure 4. Percentage of samples/experiments with statistically significant\nresults (p < 0.05) from each size groupMeanwhile, the “less” group had only ~34%\nstatistically significant results, suggesting that we shouldn’t run an\nexperiment if we cannot fulfil the sample size requirement — since we risk not\nbeing able to detect an existing effect.

They help us validate our hypotheses without having to involve our entire user base. However, any good experiment first requires the answer to the question — how do we know the right number of people to include in it?</p><p>Let’s break down why this is important. If we target too few, our experiments will not detect smaller effects, leading us to miss legitimate opportunities. If we target too many, we would be wasting resources and potentially hurting our business metrics (if the treatments turn out to be detrimental).</p><p>Previously, we used simple heuristics (and a mysterious formula) to estimate the required sample size. These practices were not very scientific and produced inconsistent experimental results. To compensate, we had to repeat the same experiment multiple times just to validate the results. Sometimes different iterations would conflict with each other, leaving everyone scratching their heads.</p><p>Last year, we ditched those unscientific practices and built a new tool called Sample Size Calculator (yes, imaginative name, we know). This post explains how the calculator helps us find the right number of people to include in experiments.</p><p>Our calculator is based on Frequentist school of statistics. Under the hood, we used both the <a href=\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pwr/vignettes/pwr-vignette.html\" rel=\"noopener\"><em><em>pwr</em></em></a> package and the base sample size calculation functions in R programming language. This is what the tool looks like:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1600/0*4kcE2olMNjGN4WFC\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Screenshot of the Sample Size Calculator used at Gojek</figcaption></figure><p>The most important parameters are the type of dependent variable measured, the historical data, and the required sensitivity from the experiment. As you can see in the graph, if we increase sensitivity to allow detection of smaller effects, the required sample size soars, which makes sense.</p><p>Although this is a major step in the right direction, there is a problem if we are interested in a continuous dependent variable for our experiment. This is because the underlying methodology used in the calculator assumes a normal distribution, while most continuous metrics that we care about at Gojek — such as <code>bookings per user</code> — are usually skewed. By ‘skewed’, we mean that most users are light users and only a small percentage are heavy users. This could cause the computed sample size requirement to be wrong because a key assumption was not met.</p><p>We have four options to deal with this problem:</p><ol><li>Use a methodology that doesn’t assume normality. Unfortunately, the available non-parametric methods are complex to implement [<a href=\"http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~ejohnson/regression/Sample%20Size%20Power%20Considerations.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\">1</a>] [<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4423589/\" rel=\"noopener\">2</a>]</li><li>Transform data to have a normal distribution. This doesn’t always work — some data just can’t be coerced to normal</li><li>Use a larger sample size. Since the worry is lower power than expected, simple multiplication should boost the power, but the multiplier needs to be reasonable. Figuring the right multiplier would be another beast on its own</li><li>Ignore it. <strong><strong>This is the path we took</strong></strong></li></ol><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/350/1*lDXre2rWb6KOp8zOdx7V-Q.gif\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><blockquote><strong>But but but… that’s not scientific!</strong></blockquote><p><strong><strong>Don’t worry. We tested the robustness of this solution before going ahead with it.</strong></strong></p><p>As you can see in the graph below, we created two right-skewed distributions with known 5% difference in means to serve as our populations. The plan is to continuously sample from this population (equivalent to replicating the same experiment many times) and see how often we can detect this 5% difference (aka what is our “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(statistics)\" rel=\"noopener\">power</a>”).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1120/0*vJpyQEMT_z3AgDSs\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption><strong>Figure 2.</strong> Two right-skewed distributions (typical shape for continuous metric at Gojek) with known mean difference (lift) of 5%</figcaption></figure><p>The first step is to calculate the required sample size with a power of 80% and minimum detectable effect of 5%. Let’s refer to this sample size requirement as the “exact” size. Then we divide and multiply it by three and call them “less” and “more”, respectively. For each sample size, we sample from the populations, compute the mean difference (typically called “lift”), and repeat this procedure many times.</p><p>The resulting distributions of lifts are shown below. The coloured vertical lines show the average lift of each experimental size, which is also equal to the actual population lift. This is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem\" rel=\"noopener\">central limit theorem</a> at work. What is interesting are the relative shapes of the sampling distributions. The “more” group is the safest and most consistent but the “exact” group seems to have good accuracy with only a third of the sample size. In the “less” group, we even see a non-negligible number of lifts that are negative, even though we know the population lift is actually +5%. This is in line with our intuition that larger sample size is generally more trustworthy than a smaller one, all else being equal.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1120/0*Jtrd9syTiZADm04j\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption><strong>Figure 3.</strong> Sampling distribution of the mean difference from each size group</figcaption></figure><p>Since we currently report the statistical significance of our experimental results at Gojek, we will also run t-test for each of our sample here.</p><p>As it turns out, 80.4% of the experiments in the “exact” group have statistically significant results (p &lt; 0.05), which is almost equal to the 80% power we set in the sample size calculator. In layman’s terms, the tool roughly promised that <em><em>if you run the experiment with this sample size, you have 80% chance of detecting a 5% lift (the minimum detectable effect) if it’s there.</em></em></p><p>Since it kept its promise even on non-normally distributed data, we can conclude that the methodology is robust to some degree of violation of the normality assumption. Therefore we can ignore it until otherwise proven.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1120/0*zF3ocylJM9iMEDue\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption><strong>Figure 4.</strong> Percentage of samples/experiments with statistically significant results (p &lt; 0.05) from each size group</figcaption></figure><p>Meanwhile, the “less” group had only ~34% statistically significant results, suggesting that we shouldn’t run an experiment if we cannot fulfil the sample size requirement — since we risk not being able to detect an existing effect.

At Gojek, we handle more than 3 million\norders a day across our 20+ products.\n\nAs you can imagine, the number of push notifications we send are proportionally\nlarge — about a million every hour to be exact.This post describes the\nchallenges we faced while working with such high notification volumes, and the\nsolutions we developed to solve them.\n\nVolume is only one part of the problem, many additional challenges were somewhat\nunique to Gojek:\n\n1. Multiple applications\nGojek isn’t comprised of just a single app. In addition to the Gojek app for\ncustomers, we also have GoLife, as well as our driver apps, merchant apps, and\nservice provider apps for GoLife.\n\nWhen one of our systems wants to send a notification, it could be for a specific\napplication of a user (for example, we don’t want to send GoLife booking\nnotifications to the Gojek app), or for all applications (for example, a\npromotional notification).\n\nOur system needed to be flexible enough to choose between an option to broadcast\nthe notification to all applications, or to a specific application.\n\n2. Multiple notification providers\nSince we support both iOS and Android for our customer applications, we needed\nto support multiple notification systems.\n\nFor Android devices, we have FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) and the deprecated\nGCM (Google Cloud Messaging) API. For iOS, we have APNS (Apple Push Notification\nservice).\n\nEach notification provider has different API keys and tokens for different\napplication IDs. For example, the FCM API key would be different for GoLife as\nopposed to Gojek.\n\n3. Multiple devices per user\nWe allow our users to stay signed in to multiple devices at a time. For us, this\nalso means that any push notification sent to the user must be sent to all of\nthe devices that the user is currently logged into.\n\nThis is also a combination of the previous two problems:\n\n 1. The user can be logged into multiple applications on a single device (Gojek\n    + GoLife)\n 2. The user may be logged into different devices, where each device requires a\n    different push notification provider. For example, a user can be logged into\n    Gojek on their Android, as well as iOS device.\n\n4. Multiple services that want to send notifications\nGojek uses a micro-service architecture, where the services of each of our\nproducts need to send notifications to our users.\n\nWe want to make it as easy as possible for any service to be able to send a\nnotification, without worrying about the multiple devices and providers that we\ndiscussed.\n\nPush notification service architecture\n\nIn order to address the above challenges, and make sure that the API remains as\nsimple as possible, we built our notification system as three components:\n\n 1. Notification server — exposes the API to send notifications, and pushes it\n    as a job on our job queue\n 2. Token store — stores the devices and devices tokens of all the currently\n    logged-in users\n 3. Notification worker — consumes jobs on the job queue and sends notifications\n    via the notification providers.\n\nEach component abstracts away some part of the problems we discussed above.\nLet’s take a look at each part in more detail:\n\n1. Token store\nOnce a user is logged into our application, the application makes a call to the\ntoken store API with their device token and application ID.\n\n\nThis entry is then removed when the user logs out.\n\n> The token store abstracts the process of deciding which devices to send a\nnotification to for each user\n2. Notification server\nThis is an HTTP server that exposes an API internally to send notifications.\n\nIn order to make things simple, the API accepts the user ID, and an optional\napplication ID as HTTP headers, and notification information in the request\nbody:\n\nPOST http://<base_url>/notification\nuser_id: <user_id>\napplication_id: <application_id>\n\n{\n\"payload\": {},\n\"title\": \"You driver is here\",\n\"message\": \"Please meet your driver at the pickup point\"\n}\n\nThe server fetches all of the users devices from the token store, and schedules\na job for each of the users devices.\n\n> The notification server abstracts the external interface to the system. Now,\nother services in Gojek that need to send out a notification just need to call\nour API with the user ID, and the system takes care of the rest\n3. Job Queue\nWe use RabbitMQ as an exchange for our job queues. We have a queue for each\napplication ID and provider type.\n\n\nThis is important because we want to isolate failures for each application and\nprovider type. For example, if our FCM token expires for com.gojek.app, we don't\nwant to stall the jobs for com.gojek.life or com.gojek.driver.bike.\n\n4. Notification workers\n\nThe worker processes consume messages from the job queues, and send out messages\nto the respective notification providers.\n\nIn order to make our code simpler, and to accommodate different service\nproviders if needed, we make use of interfaces to abstract the functionality\nimplemented by each provider:\n\ntype PushService interface {\nPush(ctx context.Context, m PushRequest) (PushResponse, error)\n}\n\nThe Push method takes a request object and returns a response object.\n\nThe request structure contains information related to the recipient and\nadditional options about the notification, like expiry time, title and text:\n\ntype PushRequest struct {\nDeviceID   string \nTitle      string\nMessage    string\nPayload    map[string]interface{}\n//some other parameters omitted\n}\n\nThe response contains information on whether the notification was sent to the\nprovider’s server successfully:\n\ntype PushResponse struct {\nSuccess         bool\nErrorMsg        string\n}\nWe then implement the interface for specific providers. For example, the code\nfor Google FCM provider, and Apples APNS provider looks something like this:\n\ntype FCMProvider struct {\n// configuration for our provider, like API token and URL endpoint\n}func (p *FCMProvider) Push(ctx context.Context, m queue.Message)\n(notification.PushResponse, error) {\n// code to send a notification payload to FCMs server\n}type APNSProvider struct {\n// configuration for our provider, like API token and URL endpoint\n}func (p *APNSProvider) Push(ctx context.Context, m queue.Message)\n(notification.PushResponse, error) {\n// code to send a notification payload to FCMs server\n}\n\n> The notification worker abstracts the process of selecting the correct provider\nto send the notification. It selects the correct provider, with the correct API\nkey based on the application ID of the message received from the queue.\nConclusion\nBy finding common patterns in the challenges we faced, and abstracting them into\ntheir own services, we turned a relatively complex problem into a suite of\nservices that are reasonably straightforward and easy to manage on their own.\n\nEach time we found a point which needed to handle multiple implementations of\nthe same core logic, we put it behind a dedicated service:\n\n 1. Multiple devices for a user was put behind the token service\n 2. Multiple applications were given a common interface on notification server\n 3. Multiple providers were handled by individual job queues and notification\n    workers\n\nIn the end, we wound up with a system that can comfortably handle over a million\nnotifications every hour.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant more updates on how we build scalable systems for Southeast Asia’s\n#SuperApp?

It selects the correct provider, with the correct API key based on the application ID of the message received from the queue.</em></em></blockquote><h1 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h1><p>By finding common patterns in the challenges we faced, and abstracting them into their own services, we turned a relatively complex problem into a suite of services that are reasonably straightforward and easy to manage on their own.</p><p>Each time we found a point which needed to handle multiple implementations of the same core logic, we put it behind a dedicated service:</p><ol><li>Multiple devices for a user was put behind the token service</li><li>Multiple applications were given a common interface on notification server</li><li>Multiple providers were handled by individual job queues and notification workers</li></ol><p>In the end, we wound up with a system that can comfortably handle <strong><strong>over a million notifications every hour</strong></strong>.</p><hr><p>Want more updates on how we build scalable systems for Southeast Asia’s #SuperApp? <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/go-jek/gojek-tech-newsletter\" rel=\"noopener\">Sign up for our newsletter!</a></p>","url":"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/how-we-manage-a-million-push-notifications-an-hour/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"b9ad7304-57c6-4ff7-9a4e-6424cb767b77","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"5ec2af987aa22c4066f83ac4","reading_time":5}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5ec2ab927aa22c4066f83a71","title":"Gojek featured in Fortune’s 2019 ‘Change the World’ list","slug":"gojek-featured-in-fortunes-2019-change-the-world-list","featured":false,"feature_image":"https://gojek-ghost.zysk.in/content/images/2020/05/1_hxz1egdrKc2PKoLvno595g.jpeg","excerpt":"GoPay recognised for the acceleration of financial inclusion in Indonesia.","custom_excerpt":"GoPay recognised for the acceleration of financial inclusion in Indonesia.","visibility":"public","created_at_pretty":"18 May, 2020","published_at_pretty":"23 August, 2019","updated_at_pretty":"18 May, 2020","created_at":"2020-05-18T21:06:50.000+05:30","published_at":"2019-08-23T09:30:00.000+05:30","updated_at":"2020-05-18T21:15:28.000+05:30","meta_title":null,"meta_description":"GoPay recognised for the acceleration of financial inclusion in Indonesia.","og_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"authors":[{"name":"Gojek","slug":"gojek","bio":null,"profile_image":null,"twitter":"@gojektech","facebook":null,"website":"http://www.gojek.io"}],"primary_author":{"name":"Gojek","slug":"gojek","bio":null,"profile_image":null,"twitter":"@gojektech","facebook":null,"website":"http://www.gojek.io"},"primary_tag":{"name":"News","slug":"news","description":"The latest official updates from Gojek—announcements, press releases, and news stories.","feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"},"tags":[{"name":"News","slug":"news","description":"The latest official updates from Gojek—announcements, press releases, and news stories.","feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"}],"plaintext":"By Apoorva Babu\n\nGojek, Southeast Asia’s leading on-demand technology platform, once again made\nit to the annual Fortune ‘Change the World’ list\n[https://fortune.com/change-the-world/2019].

Part\ntwo, which chronicles the journey of GOJEK’s Vietnam launch under the GO-VIET\nbrand, is here [http://bit.ly/2Rm2cSC].\n\nOn to part three then:\n\nPart 3/3 | Accomplishment\nThe atmosphere in Vietnam was celebratory. The GO-VIET launch had gone better\nthan anticipated, and our attempt to build robust, scalable systems looked to\nhave paid off. Ride and Send services were live in Vietnam, and engineers from\nGO-FOOD had already started working with Trifecta — the team spearheading\nGOJEK’s international moves — to launch our food product in Vietnam (FYI, it’s\nlive now).\n\nIn the months following Vietnam launch, Trifecta focused on setting up cadences\nwith different GOJEK product teams to streamline development and release cycles\nfor GO-VIET. Everything was up and running.\n\nNow, for the next stage — Thailand.\n\nThe launch plan for Thailand was similar to what had been executed in Vietnam,\nincluding the products made available at launch (Ride and Send). In Thailand,\nthe brand would launch under the name GET.\n\n> We had proven it could be done. Now it was time to do it again. Easy, right?\nAs would soon become apparent, not really. This ride had a few last twists left.\n\nA Different Method\nWhile our Thailand operation would be similar to Vietnam on the infrastructure\nfront, to say we could just replicate the model as is would be an\noversimplification. For starters, Thailand’s currency, the Thai Baht, was not a\ndepreciated currency like Indonesian Rupiah or Vietnamese Dong.\n\n> Here’s some context:\n> 1 Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) = 0.0049 INR\n1 Vietnamese Dong (VND) = 0.0030 INR\n1 Thai Baht (THB) = 2.2 INR\nIncorporating this change would require some additional work from the team. On\ntop of this, the ride sharing market in Thailand is regulated by the Thai\ngovernment. Existing bike taxis (locally called WIN taxis) are licensed by the\ngovernment to serve as an effective mode of transportation. GOJEK’s entry into\nthe market provided an opportunity for WIN drivers to leverage the online\nplatform, while giving customers easy access to transportation\n\nThis arrangement required some work as well, as existing WIN drivers onboarded\nto GET would need to be prioritised initially while our own onboarding and\ntraining happened in parallel. All this meant that the launch model needed some\ntweaking, but nothing the team would need to sweat over too much.\n\nTalks were completed, local business teams were built, and a deadline was agreed\nupon with the Thai government to launch GET.\n\n> We should have known; rarely do companies building, scaling, and expanding at\nGOJEK’s pace experience such smooth sailing.\nThe Singapore Swing\nWorks, meet spanner.\n\nDue to the seismic shift in the ride-sharing business landscape of Southeast\nAsia in early 2018, GOJEK was also prepping for launch in Singapore on an\naccelerated timeline. Now was a good time to enter the lucrative market — the\nmost developed in the region. GOJEK already enjoyed brand recognition thanks to\nthe amount of business travel between Jakarta and Singapore. By May 2018, a few\nmonths before GO-VIET went live, the launch teams for Singapore had already been\nformed.\n\n> Keeping with Singapore’s iconic lion motif, we named these teams Simba and\nMufasa. Stay tuned to this blog for their story, coming soon. 🦁\nAs 2018 drew on and all teams worked to hit their deadlines, the situation felt\na lot like the storms GOJEK weathered in its infancy. Multiple teams were\ndependent on the same resources as we lined up back-to-back country launches. To\ntop it all, holiday season — one of the busiest times of the year — was also\nkicking off.\n\nvia GIPHY [https://giphy.com/gifs/2oj7STwCx7wAM]\n\nWhile Trifecta had built much of the infrastructure framework required for\nlaunch, there were still dependencies on key GOJEK teams that were currently\nbuilding for Singapore. This threatened to slow down what was an otherwise\nstraightforward development timeline.\n\nThere was also that commitment of a launch date to the Thai Government to think\nabout. The stakes were not trivial.\n\n> The team could not afford to lose more time.

Part two, which chronicles the journey of GOJEK’s Vietnam launch under the GO-VIET brand, is <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2Rm2cSC\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p><p>On to part three then:</p><h1 id=\"part-3-3-accomplishment\">Part 3/3 | Accomplishment</h1><p>The atmosphere in Vietnam was celebratory. The GO-VIET launch had gone better than anticipated, and our attempt to build robust, scalable systems looked to have paid off. Ride and Send services were live in Vietnam, and engineers from GO-FOOD had already started working with Trifecta — the team spearheading GOJEK’s international moves — to launch our food product in Vietnam (FYI, it’s live now).</p><p>In the months following Vietnam launch, Trifecta focused on setting up cadences with different GOJEK product teams to streamline development and release cycles for GO-VIET. Everything was up and running.</p><p><strong><strong>Now, for the next stage — Thailand.</strong></strong></p><p>The launch plan for Thailand was similar to what had been executed in Vietnam, including the products made available at launch (Ride and Send). <strong><strong>In Thailand, the brand would launch under the name GET.</strong></strong></p><blockquote>We had proven it could be done. Now it was time to do it again. Easy, right?</blockquote><p><em><em>As would soon become apparent, not really. This ride had a few last twists left.</em></em></p><h1 id=\"a-different-method\">A Different Method</h1><p>While our Thailand operation would be similar to Vietnam on the infrastructure front, to say we could just replicate the model as is would be an oversimplification. For starters, Thailand’s currency, the Thai Baht, was not a depreciated currency like Indonesian Rupiah or Vietnamese Dong.</p><blockquote><em><em>Here’s some context:</em></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><em>1 Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) = 0.0049 INR</em></em><br><em><em>1 Vietnamese Dong (VND) = 0.0030 INR</em></em><br><em><em>1 Thai Baht (THB) = 2.2 INR</em></em></blockquote><p>Incorporating this change would require some additional work from the team. On top of this, the ride sharing market in Thailand is regulated by the Thai government. Existing bike taxis (locally called WIN taxis) are licensed by the government to serve as an effective mode of transportation. GOJEK’s entry into the market provided an opportunity for WIN drivers to leverage the online platform, while giving customers easy access to transportation</p><p>This arrangement required some work as well, as existing WIN drivers onboarded to GET would need to be prioritised initially while our own onboarding and training happened in parallel. All this meant that the launch model needed some tweaking, but nothing the team would need to sweat over too much.</p><p><strong><strong>Talks were completed, local business teams were built, and a deadline was agreed upon with the Thai government to launch GET.</strong></strong></p><blockquote>We should have known; rarely do companies building, scaling, and expanding at GOJEK’s pace experience such smooth sailing.</blockquote><h1 id=\"the-singapore-swing\">The Singapore Swing</h1><p><strong><strong><em><em>Works, meet spanner.</em></em></strong></strong></p><p>Due to the seismic shift in the ride-sharing business landscape of Southeast Asia in early 2018, GOJEK was also prepping for launch in Singapore on an accelerated timeline. Now was a good time to enter the lucrative market — the most developed in the region. GOJEK already enjoyed brand recognition thanks to the amount of business travel between Jakarta and Singapore. By May 2018, a few months before GO-VIET went live, the launch teams for Singapore had already been formed.</p><blockquote><em><em><em>Keeping with Singapore’s iconic lion motif, we named these teams Simba and Mufasa. Stay tuned to this blog for their story, coming soon. 🦁</em></em></em></blockquote><p>As 2018 drew on and all teams worked to hit their deadlines, the situation felt a lot like the storms GOJEK weathered in its infancy. Multiple teams were dependent on the same resources as we lined up back-to-back country launches. To top it all, holiday season — one of the busiest times of the year — was also kicking off.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/2oj7STwCx7wAM\" width=\"480\" height=\"346\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/2oj7STwCx7wAM\">via GIPHY</a></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>While Trifecta had built much of the infrastructure framework required for launch, there were still dependencies on key GOJEK teams that were currently building for Singapore. This threatened to slow down what was an otherwise straightforward development timeline.</p><p>There was also that commitment of a launch date to the Thai Government to think about. The stakes were not trivial.</p><blockquote>The team could not afford to lose more time. Time for desperate measures.</blockquote><p>With just about a month left for launch, the team members — distributed across multiple locations — convened at the GOJEK Bangalore office.

Our Data Warehouse [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehouse],\nbuilt by integrating data from multiple applications and sources, helps our team\nof data scientists, as well as business and product analysts make solid,\ndata-driven decisions.\n\nThis post explains our open source solution for easy movement of data from Kafka\nto BigQuery.\n\nData Warehouse setup at GOJEK\nWe use Google Bigquery [https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/] (BQ) as our Data\nWarehouse, which serves as a powerful tool for interactive analysis. This has\nproven extremely valuable for our use cases.\n\nOur approach to push data to our warehouse is to first push the data to Kafka.\nWe rely on multiple Kafka clusters to ingest relevant events across teams.\n\nA common approach to push data from Kafka to BigQuery is to first push it to\nGCS, and then import said data into BigQuery from GCS. While this solves the use\ncase of running analytics on historical data, we also use BigQuery for\nnear-real-time analytics & reporting. This analysis in-turn provides valuable\ninsights to make the right business decisions in a short time frame.\n\nThe initial approach\nOur original implementation used an individual code base for each topic in Kafka\nand use them to push data to BQ.\n\nThis required a lot of maintenance in order to keep up with the new topics and\nnew fields to existing topics being added to Kafka. Such changes required the\nmanual intervention of a dev/analyst to update the schema in both code and BQ\ntable. We also witnessed incidents of data loss on a few occasions, which\nrequired manually loading data from GCS.\n\nThe need for a new solution\nNew topics are added almost every other day to the several Kafka clusters in the\norganisation. Given that GOJEK has expanded its operations to several countries,\nmanaging the agglomeration of individual scripts for each topic was a massive\nordeal.\n\nIn order to deal with scaling issues, we decided to write a new system from\nscratch and take into account learnings from our previous experiences. Our\nsolution was a system that could ingest all the data pushed to Kafka and write\nit to Bigquery.\n\nWe decided to call it ‘Beast’ as it has to ingest all data that is generated in\nGOJEK.\n\nBefore starting with development, we had the following requirements to take care\nof:\n\n * No data loss: Every single message should be pushed from Kafka to BQ at least\n   once\n * Single codebase: A single repository able to handle any proto schema, for any\n   topic, without any code changes\n * Scalability: The app needs to be able to handle substantially high throughput\n * Observability: A dev should be able to see the state of the system at any\n   given point of time\n * Painless upgrades: Updating the schema for a topic should be a simple\n   operation\n\nArchitecture\n\nBeast takes inspiration from Sakaar\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/sakaar-taking-kafka-data-to-cloud-storage-at-go-jek-7839da20b5f3]\n, our in-house solution for pushing data from Kafka to GCS. Like Sakaar, Beast\nutilises Java’s blocking queues, for consuming, processing, pushing and\ncommitting the messages. Blocking queues allow us to make each of these stages\nindependent of the other, letting us optimise each stage in and of itself.\n\nEach Beast instance packs the following components:\n\n * Consumer: A native Kafka consumer, which consumes messages in batches from\n   Kafka, translates them to BQ compatible format, and pushes all of them into\n   two blocking queues — Read Queue and Commit Queue.\n * BQ Workers: A group of worker threads which pick messages from the read\n   queue, and push to BigQuery. Once a message batch is pushed successfully, the\n   BQ worker adds the committed offset of the batch to the Acknowledgement Set.\n   This offset acts as an acknowledgement of the batch being successfully\n   pushed.\n * Kafka Committer: A thread which keeps polling the head of the commit queue,\n   to get the earliest message batch. The committer looks for the commit offset\n   of that batch in the Acknowledgement Set. If the acknowledgement is available\n   (implying that the batch was successfully pushed to BQ), then the offset of\n   that batch is committed back to Kafka, and it’s removed from the commit\n   queue.\n\nSalient Features\nBeast is entirely cloud native, thus scaling it is a piece of cake.\n\nFor high throughput topics, all we need to do is spawn more pods. Since Beast\nrelies on Kafka consumers, we can have as many consumers as the number of\npartitions, and as long as they have the same consumer group, Kafka will ensure\nthat all the consumers receive unique messages.\n\nBeast takes a proto-descriptor file, which defines the details of all the protos\nin the registry. It then simply picks the details of the proto, specified in the\nconfiguration. This allows us to use the same codebase for all deployments, and\nalso makes the upgrades a breeze.\n\nBeast is open source ? ?\nBeast is now part of the open source domain.

As the Summer\nPlacements semester got going in full swing, I decided to pursue an internship\nin the Product Management domain.\n\nWhen someone asked me: “Which is your dream company?”, I was not sure. I\nrealised that although there were renowned names coming on campus, for some\nreason, I wanted something more exciting.\n\nAfter days of pondering, I decided to apply off campus. A list was compiled, and\nthe options trickled down to three: Google, LinkedIn and Gojek! Thankfully,\nGojek had a PM internship opening. I applied, interviews went well and I was\nextended an offer at the Bangalore office.\n\nChapter 1: Documentation\n1st April 2019\n\nI reached the office full of enthusiasm, ready to make a mark of my own. The\nwhole day went in different formalities and it was almost evening when I got to\nmeet my team. To my surprise, by the end of the day, I was part of all relevant\ncommunication channels, team drives and had clarity on what I would work on for\nthe next four weeks.\n\nI just loved the agility shown by my manager to enable me to embark on my\njourney. In the process, I also realised why my undergrad friends working at\nGojek used to say that if you love speed, this is the place to be.\n\nThe next few days were spent understanding the product, people, and culture. I\nwas surprised by the volume and quality of the documentation done at the\ncompany. For a company which prides itself in being one of the fastest growing\nstartups in the world, this kind of emphasis on documentation was something\nunheard of. And because of these hundreds of beautifully crafted documents, by\nthe end of the first week itself, I was participating in their BAU (Business As\nUsual) meetings. (How many interns can claim this? 😜)\n\nChapter 2: Reading\n15th April 2019\n\nI was no longer a newbie in the company. I was having 1:1s with different\nstakeholders, attending IPMs (Internal Planning Meetings), BAU meetings and\nworking tirelessly on my dedicated projects.\n\nDuring the course of these all, one day I reached out to my mentor for\nsuggestions on how to prioritise among different features. This was his\nresponse:\n\n> “Read Abhishek, Read. What differentiates a good Product Manager from an average\none is his/her willingness to learn, and reading is the first and most important\nstep there.”\nHe gave me different links to read, (37 to be precise) which ranged from Product\nPrioritization, Product Design, Product Critique, Design Heuristics and even the\nPsychology involved in product success. As I pored through them, I realised\nProduct Management is not as random as it seems from outside. In fact, it is a\nfine cocktail of art and science mixed in just the right proportion.\n\nChapter 3: Inclusion\n23rd April 2019\n\nBy this point, I had completed my first project, got positive feedback, and was\nabout to finish the second. In the meantime, being a part of so many BAU\nmeetings had boosted my confidence and now I was chipping in with suggestions.\n\nDuring one such meetings, I raised a point in contradiction to what the other\nteam was saying. I tried to explain my point of view but we were not able to\ncome to an agreement. When I came out, I realised that I should have dealt with\nthe situation differently. I went to my mentor and explained as much.\n\n> To this, he said: “Sometimes it’s not only about how you or your team is looking\nat things. You also have to look at what is the value proposition of other teams\ninvolved”\nThis was the second important lesson which I learnt: being a PM your job is to\nfirst bring everyone at the table to a common ground before pushing any agenda. \nWhether it is inter-team or intra-team, to get the job done, you have to bring\npeople to your side by understanding what they want and why they want it.\n\nChapter 4: Relevance\n30th April 2019\n\nI had just finished my second project when I met a senior engineer while passing\nthrough the pantry area. He asked how it’s going and what I was working on. I,\nwith full excitement, told him many ideas I came up with.\n\nAnd then he said: “Man, it doesn’t matter how cool the ideas are or how great\nthey sound. Judge them on their relevance. Are they correctly solving the\nproblem intended? Are they adding value to the lives of relevant stakeholders?”\nAnd then he gave me a set of 10 similar questions and said that if after\nanswering these 10 questions, you still believe you should implement the idea, \nthen it matters.\n\nChapter 5: Impact\n7th May 2019\n\nI had started understanding the nitty-gritty of product management and was\nraring to pick a more challenging project. And then I got this mail from my\nmanager:\n\nReally??? After such nice product & strategy based projects, this is what you\nwant me to do!!\n\n> But again, that was my inexperience talking.\nDuring the course of the next week, I learnt one more valuable lesson: “Look at\nthe impact of your work, not how cool it sounds. Being a PM, the world is your\ndomain and processes are as important as the product itself. If you want your\nproduct to succeed, you need to oil the whole machinery.”\n\nRecently, I came to know that a senior PM found the document to be super good\nand now it is being used across the substreams to onboard new hires. (I’m\nallowed one humblebrag right? 😅)\n\nChapter 6: Communication\n21st May 2019\n\nThe changing weather of Bangalore had hit me hard and I had to take a leave\nowing to ill health. I sent a message each to my manager and mentor regarding\nthe same. My mentor replied asking me to inform the whole team, which I missed\nand read quite late. When I did, I figured I am an intern anyway, and don’t have\nany current projects with the team. Even if I don’t send the mail to them, it\ndoesn’t matter much.\n\nWhen I met my mentor the next day, he asked why I didn’t send the mail, and I\nexplained why. He said: “Abhishek, it doesn’t matter whether you have a current\nproject with the team or not. Being a PM, one of the most important skills is\nbeing very clear in communication. There might be situations where you wouldn’t\neven know and people would be waiting for you. Not only in this case, but in\nevery everything you do, a PM needs to be a clear and careful communicator.”\n\nChapter 7: Ownership\n24th May 2019\n\nMy internship was nearing it’s end, and I reached out to my mentor for some\nsuggestions on the last project I was working on. During our conversation, he\nasked if my previous one had gone live in production. I said no, but clarified\nthat my part is done and it is stuck on other collaborating teams.\n\nThat’s when I realised I had one last lesson left to learn:\n\n> “Being a PM it’s your job to get it from conception to production. If there are\nblockers, you have to proactively reach out to remove them. Being a PM is a\ntricky job, once you have dirtied your hand, the onus comes on you to get it to\ncompletion.”\n> “Once you have picked up something — It’s All Yours.”\nEpilogue\nToday, when I look back, my internship at Gojek was a short, but sweet journey\nwhich taught me many lessons. As I go back for my second year at IIMA, I am much\nmore confident when it comes to Product Management.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSpecial thanks to my manager Vikrama Dhiman, my mentor Manas J Saloi, Shobhit\nSrivastava, and all the members of the Transport team who were always ready to\nhelp me during the course of my journey.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant more updates on how we build scalable systems for Southeast Asia’s\n#SuperApp?

If you haven’t\nread part one, get up to speed here.\n\nPart 2/3 | Initiation\nWhen we left Trifecta — the team responsible for charting GOJEK’s international\nexpansion — in the last part of this series, the team was working on setting up\na new environment for launch in Vietnam. But now, there were new problems to\ntackle.\n\nProblem #1: Configuration drift\n\nUntil this point, GOJEK had always operated within Indonesia, but Trifecta was\nnow in unmapped territory, building a completely new environment for GOJEK’s\nservices in Vietnam. The services now needed to be configured separately across\ngeographies, and there was no central location to manage these configurations\neffectively. This meant there was a chance of configuration inconsistencies\ncreeping in over time (hence the term ‘drift’).\n\nProblem #2: Deployment drift\n\nEven if the team hacked a solution for the first problem, deploying the code\nwould pose another one. It was imperative that the same version of code run on\nall the environments (the existing one in Indonesia, the one being built for\nVietnam, and any future ones). Failing this, supporting services across\ncountries would be a nightmare.\n\n> That wasn’t the kind of risk a startup that expounds lean engineering could\nafford to take.\nProblem #3: A logging and monitoring solution for the Kubernetes cluster.\n\nAs this was the first time containers were being used by GOJEK, a new logging\nsolution would be required for future debugging needs.\n\nMuch time had been lost already, it was time to bring in the big guns.\n\nEven as the team dodged obstacles and took detours, making the best use of\navailable resources, Project Managers Sourabh Gupta and Sanchit Juneja had been\ncommunicating with other teams for backup. They had found some ad-hoc support,\nbut to see this journey through would need more seasoned soldiers.\n\nFinally, this effort came to fruition.\n\nTrifecta V2.0\nAfter some negotiation, the team got the go-ahead for Sumit Gupta, another GOJEK\nveteran, to make the transition from GOJEK’s Atlas team to join Trifecta full\ntime. Sumit had led GOJEK’s scaling efforts back in 2015, when the company was\nin constant firefighting mode, and knew a thing or two about dealing with the\nkind of situation the team was in. He would now assume the role of Trifecta’s\nTech Lead.\n\nWith a renewed sense of purpose, the team looked back at the roadmap and\nreassessed priorities. This would be a challenging project. Daunting, yes.\nInsurmountable? Not quite.\n\n> If you’ve read GOJEK’s essential reading list\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/the-go-jek-reading-list-1088712ccc14], you\nmay have noticed that The Mythical Man Month is one of the books we swear by,\nand one of its core tenets is: “Adding more people to a late software project\nmakes it later.”\n> We added four more engineers to the team.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDimensions and distant visions\nGOJEK did not have previously devised solutions for the drifts it was dealing\nwith. It needed new ones.\n\nTackling configuration drift.\n\nIt would now be Trifecta’s job to create a location within which services for\ndifferent environments could be configured and accessed.\n\nThe solution was a service that used a new API to update configurations across\ngeographies. These were then migrated to a configuration store.\n\nThis store was named Yggdrasil, the mythical Norse tree that connects the nine\nrealms. Even in the frenzied sprint to accomplish a daunting task, we could\nnever resist the temptation of poetic nomenclature. 😅\n\n> Yggdrasil changed how configs were stored and managed in GOJEK.\nTackling deployment drift\n\nCode.\n\nCode fuels GOJEK, and ensuring that updated code is running in sync is one of\nthe primary objectives of any team. Trifecta was no different — except for\nscale.\n\nThe team needed to figure out a way to ensure that the same version of code ran\nacross multiple, disconnected environments. It was time to forge a new\naccessory.\n\n> A Palantir — a seeing stone.\nWhen new versions of an application are released, there is a need to deploy the\nsame version on all countries for the given environment. Palantir would take\ncare of figuring out which countries the given deployment should go to.\n\nThe team also built a UI for Palantir, which gave a view of what version of a\nservice was deployed in which cluster and sent alerts when there was a drift.\n\nTackling the logging problem\n\nAs launch date drew closer, this particular problem required non-linear\nthinking. Trifecta implemented an out-of-the-box solution using Stackdriver to\nunblock themselves for the launch. This was not optimal, but it provided enough\nbreathing room to get through launch (post which specific tooling for logging on\ncontainers could be created).\n\nOnce again, the destination appeared near. With Yggdrasil keeping the services\nstable and Palantir keeping watch on code, GO-VIET was no longer a wistful\ndream, it was a visible apparition.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRun with Red\nIf you visit Indonesia, chances are you’ll see bright flecks of green amidst the\ntraffic.\n\n> Green jackets, green helmets, green… everywhere. Green is now part of GOJEK’s\nidentity in Indonesia, it is instant mental recall for the brand.\n> But this was not Indonesia.\n> GO-VIET, it was decided, would be born in red.\nA local leadership team was put together in order to assemble other teams\nrequired for launch. This team was also flown to Jakarta to understand GOJEK’s\nvalues and how it works. These would serve as the core values for GO-VIET as\nwell, with the leadership adapting things as required to suit Vietnam.\n\nMeanwhile, Trifecta was stabilising the launch environment, collaborating with\nthe newly-minted team in Vietnam, and working with multiple GOJEK teams.\n\nBy June of 2018, the backend was ready. A working driver and consumer app, as\nwell as on-boarding portals for driver partners had been set up, along with\ncrucial business-related teams like BI and Fraud. GO-VIET was taking shape right\nin front of its makers’ eyes.\n\n> Now for the testing:\nOver the next one month, the app, and by extension, the new environment and\nassorted services, were put through the wringer. First, employees mocking as\ndrivers tried it in a staging environment, then the actual on-boarded drivers\nwere given a shot, so the team could record their feedback.\n\nTesting then moved to the production environment. It was time for the real deal.\nThe dry runs began, and in the final phase of testing, early adopters were given\naccess to try out the alpha version of the app.\n\nFinally, it was done. The environment, the services, the app, the operations,\nthe tree, the stone… they had all survived.\n\n> GO-VIET was ready.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe final push\nJuly 31, 2018 — Vietnam Beckoned\n\nThe environment was ready, everything was up and running. The app was live, with\nconfigurations changed so drivers would not be visible to anyone who downloaded\nit.\n\nGearing up for launch.At 11.30 pm, the toggle was switched and test bookings\nwere made on production with actual drivers and employees. The GO-VIET COO took\nthe first ride. All was good.\n\nExcitement was running high, and even GOJEK CEO Nadiem Makarim was in Ho-Chi\nMinh City (the first of GO-VIET’s operation centres) for the launch.\n\nAs the clock struck midnight, Trifecta hit the button, and specks of red lit up\non the map within users’ GO-VIET apps. A few driver partners present at the\nlaunch venue confirmed that everything was working according to plan. It was\ndone, we were live.\n\nCelebrating a job well done.> GOJEK had gone international.\nCheers, high fives, applause, congratulations, the pop of celebratory drinks.\n\nVietnam, we’re here!Rumour has it, everyone present tried to guess how many\norders GO-VIET would garner on its first day. Expectations were exceeded. The\nbrand new service did >2,500 orders on day one, more than what GOJEK achieved on\nits first day in Indonesia.\n\nIt had been a long journey of planning and learning. The job was done; the path\nto Vietnam was charted. In the month of September, a formal launch was held,\nadding Hanoi to the list of cites the service operated in.\n\nGOJEK, Indonesia’s first unicorn, had finally left home to find its place in the\nworld. Now, all eyes turned to Thailand.

Failing this, supporting services across countries would be a nightmare.</p><blockquote><em><em>That wasn’t the kind of risk a startup that expounds lean engineering could afford to take.</em></em></blockquote><p><strong><strong>Problem #3: A logging and monitoring solution for the Kubernetes cluster.</strong></strong></p><p>As this was the first time containers were being used by GOJEK, a new logging solution would be required for future debugging needs.</p><p><em><em>Much time had been lost already, it was time to bring in the big guns.</em></em></p><p>Even as the team dodged obstacles and took detours, making the best use of available resources, Project Managers Sourabh Gupta and Sanchit Juneja had been communicating with other teams for backup. They had found some ad-hoc support, but to see this journey through would need more seasoned soldiers.</p><p>Finally, this effort came to fruition.</p><h1 id=\"trifecta-v2-0\">Trifecta V2.0</h1><p>After some negotiation, the team got the go-ahead for Sumit Gupta, another GOJEK veteran, to make the transition from GOJEK’s Atlas team to join Trifecta full time. Sumit had led GOJEK’s scaling efforts back in 2015, when the company was in constant firefighting mode, and knew a thing or two about dealing with the kind of situation the team was in. He would now assume the role of Trifecta’s Tech Lead.</p><p>With a renewed sense of purpose, the team looked back at the roadmap and reassessed priorities. This would be a challenging project. <strong><strong>Daunting, yes. Insurmountable? Not quite.</strong></strong></p><blockquote><em><em><em>If you’ve read </em><a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/the-go-jek-reading-list-1088712ccc14\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>GOJEK’s essential reading list</em></a><em>, you may have noticed that </em>The Mythical Man Month<em> is one of the books we swear by, and one of its core tenets is: “Adding more people to a late software project makes it later.”</em></em></em></blockquote><blockquote>We added four more engineers to the team.</blockquote><hr><h1 id=\"dimensions-and-distant-visions\">Dimensions and distant visions</h1><p>GOJEK did not have previously devised solutions for the drifts it was dealing with. It needed new ones.</p><p><strong><strong>Tackling configuration drift.</strong></strong></p><p>It would now be Trifecta’s job to create a location within which services for different environments could be configured and accessed.</p><p>The solution was a service that used a new API to update configurations across geographies. These were then migrated to a configuration store.</p><p>This store was named Yggdrasil, the mythical Norse tree that connects the nine realms. Even in the frenzied sprint to accomplish a daunting task, we could never resist the temptation of poetic nomenclature. 😅</p><blockquote>Yggdrasil changed how configs were stored and managed in GOJEK.</blockquote><p><strong><strong>Tackling deployment drift</strong></strong></p><p><em><em>Code</em></em>.</p><p>Code fuels GOJEK, and ensuring that updated code is running in sync is one of the primary objectives of any team. Trifecta was no different — except for scale.</p><p>The team needed to figure out a way to ensure that the same version of code ran across multiple, disconnected environments. It was time to forge a new accessory.</p><blockquote>A Palantir — a seeing stone.</blockquote><p>When new versions of an application are released, there is a need to deploy the same version on all countries for the given environment. Palantir would take care of figuring out which countries the given deployment should go to.</p><p>The team also built a UI for Palantir, which gave a view of what version of a service was deployed in which cluster and sent alerts when there was a drift.</p><p><strong><strong>Tackling the logging problem</strong></strong></p><p>As launch date drew closer, this particular problem required non-linear thinking. Trifecta implemented an out-of-the-box solution using Stackdriver to unblock themselves for the launch. This was not optimal, but it provided enough breathing room to get through launch (post which specific tooling for logging on containers could be created).</p><p>Once again, the destination appeared near. With Yggdrasil keeping the services stable and Palantir keeping watch on code, GO-VIET was no longer a wistful dream, it was a visible apparition.</p><hr><h1 id=\"run-with-red\">Run with Red</h1><p>If you visit Indonesia, chances are you’ll see bright flecks of green amidst the traffic.</p><blockquote><em><em>Green jackets, green helmets, green… everywhere. Green is now part of GOJEK’s identity in Indonesia, it is instant mental recall for the brand.</em></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><em>But this was not Indonesia.</em></em></blockquote><blockquote>GO-VIET, it was decided, would be born in red.</blockquote><p>A local leadership team was put together in order to assemble other teams required for launch. This team was also flown to Jakarta to understand GOJEK’s values and how it works. These would serve as the core values for GO-VIET as well, with the leadership adapting things as required to suit Vietnam.</p><p>Meanwhile, Trifecta was stabilising the launch environment, collaborating with the newly-minted team in Vietnam, and working with multiple GOJEK teams.</p><p>By June of 2018, the backend was ready. A working driver and consumer app, as well as on-boarding portals for driver partners had been set up, along with crucial business-related teams like BI and Fraud. GO-VIET was taking shape right in front of its makers’ eyes.</p><blockquote>Now for the testing:</blockquote><p>Over the next one month, the app, and by extension, the new environment and assorted services, were put through the wringer. First, employees mocking as drivers tried it in a staging environment, then the actual on-boarded drivers were given a shot, so the team could record their feedback.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/2592/1*dTinrKKxi8iegPBzQWP9Hg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Testing then moved to the production environment. It was time for the real deal. The dry runs began, and in the final phase of testing, early adopters were given access to try out the alpha version of the app.</p><p>Finally, it was done. The environment, the services, the app, the operations, the tree, the stone… they had all survived.</p><blockquote>GO-VIET was ready.</blockquote><hr><h1 id=\"the-final-push\">The final push</h1><p><strong><strong><em><em>July 31, 2018 — Vietnam Beckoned</em></em></strong></strong></p><p>The environment was ready, everything was up and running. The app was live, with configurations changed so drivers would not be visible to anyone who downloaded it.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/4032/1*qskOob8GzQG4dfQNtb6__Q.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Gearing up for launch.</figcaption></figure><p>At 11.30 pm, the toggle was switched and test bookings were made on production with actual drivers and employees. The GO-VIET COO took the first ride.

A few driver partners present at the launch venue confirmed that everything was working according to plan.
