While it is extremely rewarding, it is also\nchallenging. This is because we often work on tough problems with no clear\nsolution — which involves taking risks and learning things on the fly.\n\nAll this, while competing with the best in the industry.\n\nThat’s why our guiding principles serve as a great reference point to deal with\nsituations that arise every day. Here are some that we abide by:\n\nEveryone writes code — At Gojek, we believe that Software\nPrincipals/Architects/Engineers can only do the right thing when they work on\ncode themselves. It’s the only way to decide what’s working and what’s not. We\ndon’t believe that software requires a 50,000 foot overview with people\nexclusively working on the blueprint. At Gojek, writing software is not a\nlow-level task; it’s at the very core of what we do.\n\nLeaders who code are better judges of technical skill.\n\nEveryone needs to ‘walk the talk’ — We respect people who get down in the\ntrenches and take a hands-on approach to problem solving. Based on our\nexperience, standing at a distance and issuing commandments has many a time been\ninefficient and error prone, and hence we avoid this.\n\nLeaders are grown and not made — We believe in acquired respect and leadership,\nnot leadership by position. At Gojek, you earn your leadership mettle. We\nbelieve in helping our people grow into leadership roles by giving them chances,\nrisk appetite and freedom. We trust our people and support them to do the right\nthing at any given moment. In my own career, I’ve been privileged enough to have\nfound some amazing mentors, and I am glad to be able to continue the legacy at\nGojek.\n\nEvery decision is correct at the time it is made — Swift decision-making is\nextremely important in a fast paced environment like ours. Once a decision is\nmade, we don’t constantly agonise over it or second guess. We trust that\nwhenever someone makes a decision, it is the right one, given the information\navailable to them at that time. Only the passage of time can tell us whether a\nparticular decision was right or wrong. It’s OK to change decisions, and we\nencourage people to not be afraid to make a decision.\n\nEvery person has some strengths, even if we don’t always see them — A great team\nis built with a group of people who have complementary skill sets. A combination\nof different strengths make teams that can tackle all kinds of situations. At\nGojek, we believe each one of us is unique and has unique strengths. It’s just a\nmatter of finding the right role to match the skills. Teams become super strong\nwhen they appreciate each other’s strengths.\n\nWorking in tech means learning all the time — Learning is important in every\nfield. In the technology industry, it is a matter of life and death. Technology\nis changing all the time, what worked a decade ago may be completely obsolete\nnow. For example, practices that worked in Waterfall don’t work in Agile, and\nuser experiences on mobile apps were unimaginable a few years back. So, we\nconstantly look for and admire people who are curious and willing to learn.\n\nThe best part? Such people will always hire people they can learn from!\n\nPair Programming and Test-Driven Development (TDD) work — If they didn’t, our\nteams wouldn’t exist. Wherever we have followed this, we found our team’s job on\nsupporting software is more around features than bugs! We have experienced over\ndecades that this helps us build features faster, and mature teams organically.\nThe bottom line is : to write beautiful code, we believe there is no better way\nthan rigorous pair programming and practising TDD.","html":"<p>By Ajey Gore</p><p>Working at Gojek means working with the best and brightest on the most cutting-edge technologies.
