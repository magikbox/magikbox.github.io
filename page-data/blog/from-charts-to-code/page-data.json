You know that the work you do helps\nimpact the lives of thousands of people across Southeast Asia. You’re good at\nwhat you do — but you’re unsatisfied. On a personal level, the work doesn’t \nexcite you anymore.\n\nYou’re looking to hit the restart button on your career.\n\nThat’s how I felt after a stint as a business analyst. The work and the people\nwere great, but I wasn’t fully satisfied with what I was doing, and wanted to\nsupport the company in a different capacity. Luckily, thanks to Gojek’s internal\ntransfer programs, the entire organisation was open to me. From roles in product\nmanagement in Business Intelligence (they’re\n[https://www.gojek.io/all-open-positions?d=product&t=product-management&p=40f69246-2821-4a01-a359-64b5b6bf3b02] \n hiring\n[https://www.gojek.io/all-open-positions?d=product&t=product-management&p=e707ab22-f28f-45a7-9130-4c036ca5da91]\n!) to product and performance analysis in GoFood, I was definitely spoiled for\nchoice.\n\nHowever, thanks to the stream of articles coming from this very blog, I found\nmyself yearning to enter Gojek’s vast Engineering and Product Development (EPD)\ngroup. Having that kind of impact across Southeast Asia and getting to work with\nextremely talented engineers really appealed to me, and I felt I could make a\ngood contribution.\n\nBut before I could make my move, I had to make sure I knew what I was getting\ninto. Was my desire to move rising out of discontent, or something that could be\neasily resolved? If I could even get into EPD, what would I be working on?\n\nWould I even enjoy my new position, or find myself pining for something new\nagain? Would all my efforts have been for naught?\n\nThis post is for anyone in a similar situation, and lists things to consider\nbefore taking the leap:\n\nDiscern your motivation\nTake time to introspect, and pick apart your motivations. What’s driving your\ndecision to move? Are you unsatisfied with your current job? Do you have issues\nwith your role, your team, your boss? Are you looking for a new adventure in a\nbrand new area? Are you ready to put in time outside of work to train yourself\nfor the new position?\n\nAsking yourself these pointed questions can help define what you really yearn\nfor, and outline how to get there. Which brings us to the next point.\n\nFind your niche\nCheck your company’s job listings online to understand what they’re looking for.\nRead them thoroughly to understand the skills you need before applying. Are\nthere positions available for entry-level engineers? If so, prioritise these\npositions, as they require less programming experience, and provide a\nspringboard for you to supercharge your growth as an engineer.\n\nTalk to engineers\nThe biggest advantage of moving internally is you already have access to many of\nyour (potentially) future peers. Have a casual conversation with your company’s\ndevelopers to understand the expectations of the job. Use this as an opportunity\nto go beyond the job description — to really understand what it’s like working\nin your desired position. What technologies do they use on a day-to-day basis?\nDo they have to work odd hours? What’s the career path like? We don’t bite! (We\ndo love bytes, though!) ?\n\nBy this stage, I had become confident in my choice to jump to the Engineering\ndivision. I decided I wanted a new adventure to head on, established a niche I\ncould aim for, and did the groundwork. But the big challenge lay ahead:\n\nHow would I accomplish the jump? I knew Gojek had (and still has) high\nexpectations for anyone who wants to join the division.\n\nThe comforting factor was that Gojek is incredibly open to anybody who can prove\nthemselves. Many successful engineers in Gojek made jumps like the one I wanted\nto make, and some of them had no formal training in computer science or software\ndevelopment! If anything, that was proof that anybody who strove and acted had a\nshot at success.\n\nNow that you’ve made your choice: here are some tips to help propel you forward\nin tech as a beginner:\n\nUpgrade your skills:\nNow that you know what skills your desired position requires on a daily basis,\nit’s time to put in the hours training up. There are countless guides on the\nInternet for every technology under the Sun, so pick one and follow it through!\nDon’t forget to do the exercises included, and work on pet projects to really\nhone in on what you’ve just learned. Remember: practice makes perfect!\n\nJoin company training programs:\nAside from taking up personal projects, look around to see if your company has\nset up training and development programs. These would be directly aligned with\nwhat your company is looking for in engineers, and offer a framework for you to\ngrow with. In Gojek, we’re lucky to have two major programs:\n\n * The Gojek Tech Bootcamp. Designed for fresh grads taking on an entry-level\n   position in EPD across all divisions, the Bootcamp helps accelerate the\n   growth of would-be engineers through full immersion — the philosophy, the\n   practices, the works.\n * The GoAcademy program. Intended for anyone in the company looking for a\n   structured way to grow in areas from data analysis and visualisation to\n   personal wellness, GoAcademy sets up tutorials led by experienced engineers,\n   fully contextualised to meet the needs of GoTroops from different teams and\n   fields.\n\nContribute to open-source:\nIf you don’t have enough experience to meet the requirements of your desired\nposition, fret not! Look into contributing to open-source projects to level up.\nContributing to open source works very much like contributing to a product team.\nYou’ll be working on real bugs reported by users, or even proposing your own\nfeatures to implement. The biggest open-source projects have vibrant communities\nthat are very welcoming of newcomers — some even have bugs specifically marked\nfor solving by new developers!\n\nThe benefits of working on open-source only increases if you can find and\ncontribute to projects launched by your own company. (You can find a list of\nwhat Gojek has contributed so far over here [https://github.com/gojek].) You’ll\nget to showcase your collaboration and problem-solving skills to your future\nfellow engineers — all before sending in an application!\n\nBonus point: should you contribute using GitHub, GitLab, or any public tool,\nyou’ll have a portfolio ready to link to and show around!\n\nTalk to tech leads and product managers:\nMuch like talking to engineers, speaking with tech leads and product managers\nwill give you a sense of what the job would be like, but on a higher level. Use\nthis opportunity to ask about the current state of the team, the obstacles\nthey’re facing, and future of the product. Position yourself in their eyes as\nsomeone who is ready to learn and contribute — you’ll be making your mark before\nyou even have a formal interview!\n\nAs for me, I’m now a Product Engineer, part of Gojek’s Operations Platform,\nworking on our internal service product and helping maintain our customer\nsupport platform. It’s been almost a year since I made the decision to switch\nroles, and I’m glad to say that, even though it took several months to find a\nrole that met my desires and the needs of the company, I’ve found a place where\nI can grow and contribute to Gojek.\n\nWhile my new world is far removed from the spreadsheets and queries of my old\none, the skills I honed back then remain incredibly relevant and essential to my\nnew duties. The eye for numbers and detail I developed has been crucial for\nspotting points of improvement in development. The communication skills I gained\nfrom presenting to higher-ups has helped me describe my ideas clearly. My time\nas a business analyst was not a waste in the least bit — in fact, it helped me\ntowards faster growth and success in my new role.\n\nIf you’re in a similar position and contemplating changing roles, I hope this\narticle has helped in the decision process. ?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant our updates to appear in your inbox?
