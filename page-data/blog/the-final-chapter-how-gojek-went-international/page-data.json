Part\ntwo, which chronicles the journey of GOJEK’s Vietnam launch under the GO-VIET\nbrand, is here [http://bit.ly/2Rm2cSC].\n\nOn to part three then:\n\nPart 3/3 | Accomplishment\nThe atmosphere in Vietnam was celebratory. The GO-VIET launch had gone better\nthan anticipated, and our attempt to build robust, scalable systems looked to\nhave paid off. Ride and Send services were live in Vietnam, and engineers from\nGO-FOOD had already started working with Trifecta — the team spearheading\nGOJEK’s international moves — to launch our food product in Vietnam (FYI, it’s\nlive now).\n\nIn the months following Vietnam launch, Trifecta focused on setting up cadences\nwith different GOJEK product teams to streamline development and release cycles\nfor GO-VIET. Everything was up and running.\n\nNow, for the next stage — Thailand.\n\nThe launch plan for Thailand was similar to what had been executed in Vietnam,\nincluding the products made available at launch (Ride and Send). In Thailand,\nthe brand would launch under the name GET.\n\n> We had proven it could be done. Now it was time to do it again. Easy, right?\nAs would soon become apparent, not really. This ride had a few last twists left.\n\nA Different Method\nWhile our Thailand operation would be similar to Vietnam on the infrastructure\nfront, to say we could just replicate the model as is would be an\noversimplification. For starters, Thailand’s currency, the Thai Baht, was not a\ndepreciated currency like Indonesian Rupiah or Vietnamese Dong.\n\n> Here’s some context:\n> 1 Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) = 0.0049 INR\n1 Vietnamese Dong (VND) = 0.0030 INR\n1 Thai Baht (THB) = 2.2 INR\nIncorporating this change would require some additional work from the team. On\ntop of this, the ride sharing market in Thailand is regulated by the Thai\ngovernment. Existing bike taxis (locally called WIN taxis) are licensed by the\ngovernment to serve as an effective mode of transportation. GOJEK’s entry into\nthe market provided an opportunity for WIN drivers to leverage the online\nplatform, while giving customers easy access to transportation\n\nThis arrangement required some work as well, as existing WIN drivers onboarded\nto GET would need to be prioritised initially while our own onboarding and\ntraining happened in parallel. All this meant that the launch model needed some\ntweaking, but nothing the team would need to sweat over too much.\n\nTalks were completed, local business teams were built, and a deadline was agreed\nupon with the Thai government to launch GET.\n\n> We should have known; rarely do companies building, scaling, and expanding at\nGOJEK’s pace experience such smooth sailing.\nThe Singapore Swing\nWorks, meet spanner.\n\nDue to the seismic shift in the ride-sharing business landscape of Southeast\nAsia in early 2018, GOJEK was also prepping for launch in Singapore on an\naccelerated timeline. Now was a good time to enter the lucrative market — the\nmost developed in the region. GOJEK already enjoyed brand recognition thanks to\nthe amount of business travel between Jakarta and Singapore. By May 2018, a few\nmonths before GO-VIET went live, the launch teams for Singapore had already been\nformed.\n\n> Keeping with Singapore’s iconic lion motif, we named these teams Simba and\nMufasa. Stay tuned to this blog for their story, coming soon. 🦁\nAs 2018 drew on and all teams worked to hit their deadlines, the situation felt\na lot like the storms GOJEK weathered in its infancy. Multiple teams were\ndependent on the same resources as we lined up back-to-back country launches. To\ntop it all, holiday season — one of the busiest times of the year — was also\nkicking off.\n\nvia GIPHY [https://giphy.com/gifs/2oj7STwCx7wAM]\n\nWhile Trifecta had built much of the infrastructure framework required for\nlaunch, there were still dependencies on key GOJEK teams that were currently\nbuilding for Singapore. This threatened to slow down what was an otherwise\nstraightforward development timeline.\n\nThere was also that commitment of a launch date to the Thai Government to think\nabout. The stakes were not trivial.\n\n> The team could not afford to lose more time. Time for desperate measures.\nWith just about a month left for launch, the team members — distributed across\nmultiple locations — convened at the GOJEK Bangalore office. All the\ndocumentation done during the pre-Vietnam launch phase meant that everyone had a\nfair idea of what needed to be done. Launching Singapore and Thailand without\ndelay was critical to business, and we could not afford delays.\n\nWith this in mind, tough decisions were made. The Trifecta team decided to roll\nup their sleeves and take full ownership of Thailand, freeing up the GOJEK\nTransport team to dedicate more resources to Singapore. Trifecta team members\nflew in to Thailand to coordinate the work there, and the project slowly picked\nup steam once again. All the legwork done at the beginning of this exercise had\ncome to fruition.\n\nThe team now had enough context about GOJEK services, and as the days to launch\nticked away, so did the items on the pre-launch checklist.\n\nIt took some doing, with the environment and frameworks built and stabilised\nwhile activities like driver onboarding and early alpha testing happened in\nparallel.\n\n> The going was not easy, but this wasn’t our first rodeo.\nTrifecta Tech Lead Sumit Gupta, who was around in early 2016 during GOJEK’s\nfrantic growth as well, mentions how everyone was more confident this time\naround. Thanks to to the team deciding to build a fast and scalable\ncontainer-based architecture for Vietnam and Thailand, they were sure the system\nwould function reliably. 💪\n\nThe home stretch\nDespite the apprehensions, Trifecta managed to pull through. What had been a\nsystem unfit for launch just a few weeks before the stipulated date, was up and\nrunning with a couple of days to go. The team’s faith was well-rewarded. As\nlaunch day came around, nothing broke.\n\nBagus Santoso and Ardi Priono, QAs on the Trifecta team, recall how everyone\npresent gathered outside the GET office on the day of the soft launch, and\nprayed.\n\n> People of different nationalities, faiths, and professional backgrounds, united\nin a moment of reflection and hope for something they had built together.\nThe day of the soft launch.On November 29, 2018, the GOJEK app successfully went\nlive in Singapore. The next month, December 18 to be precise, GET’s fluorescent\ncolours lit up Bangkok. We were officially live in Thailand. \n\nRiding off to new horizons.> Our SuperApp had ventured beyond home. Team Trifecta\nhad accomplished the task it had been set.\n> Looking back, this had been an ambitious endeavour. Setting up new environments,\nusing the learnings from scaling GOJEK to build improved infrastructure, and\nlaunching two new brands.\nIf there was one thing this exercise taught us, it was to reduce dependencies.\nToday, each GOJEK team is responsible for maintaining their product features and\nservices wherever they may be deployed.\n\nIn service of this decision, Trifecta started the exercise of imparting all the\nknowledge, tools, and documentation gathered over the year to the relevant teams\nwithin GOJEK. Hands-on sessions and workshops were held, and learnings\ntransferred. The goal now was to provide each team the tools and autonomy\nrequired to not face such roadblocks again.\n\n> Once this process was complete, their task done, the fellowship that steered\nGOJEK to foreign lands was disbanded.\nArmed with new experience, the GOJEK engineers left Trifecta and joined other\nproduct teams.

They moved to\nGOJEK’s newly-formed Kernel team, to help take on one of our biggest challenges\nyet.\n\nBut that is a story for another day.\n\nThis series was a snapshot of how we do things at GOJEK. Even as you read this,\nthere are many more such stories developing.
