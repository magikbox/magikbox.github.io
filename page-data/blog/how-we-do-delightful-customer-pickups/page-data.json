The feeling of going to a big mall in an unfamiliar place,\ntrying to book a ride, but not knowing which is the most convenient pickup spot.\n\nDo I try the north entrance? Oh wait, there’s a one-way there, might need to\nwait a long while.\n\nAh, I got a driver but I don’t know how to tell her which side I am on. Wait,\nthere’s a Starbucks here. I’m in front of Starbucks!\n\nOh, you’re near McDonalds? Wait, maybe I can just come to you. But, how do I get\nto McDonalds now? ?‍♂️\n\n> Yeah, we’ve all been there.\nPickup points may seem like trivial things, but when you operate on a scale of\nmillions of orders per day, smoother pickups which require less coordination\n(and time) mean our customers get places faster, and our driver partners earn\nmore.\n\nIn this post, we’ll talk about how Gojek improved the pickup experience for\ncustomers and partners using Points of Interest (POI) — like a mall — and then\nstreamlined pickups around these areas using Pre-Defined Pickup Points (PPOI).\n\nThe Breakdown\nMany of the cities Gojek operates in are highly congested urban settings, where\nlocations are often not properly labelled on maps and pickup points can be hard\nto determine. This initially led to a lot of additional coordination between\npartners and customers over the phone, which is not the best use of anyone’s\ntime.\n\nIn order to streamline this process, we first began identifying POIs in popular\nareas. Once this was done, we located areas around these landmarks where lots of\npickups happened, and began suggesting them as pre-defined pickup points to our\nusers. Making these suggestions within the app was the first step in reducing\nthe cognitive load associated with pickups. (If you’d like to know how we\nidentified these spots. Check out this post\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/how-i-met-my-gojek-driver-without-a-single-call-95041f4fdd03]\n).\n\nOur next step in the process was to provide customers some details about the\nquality of these locations. We started showing them more details about the\npickup points near them—are they sheltered from weather, in case the driver\nneeds a couple of minutes to reach them? If it’s night, is it well-lit?\n\nBut wait, there’s more…\nPPOIs have contributed hugely to streamlining pickups and making life easier for\nour stakeholders. But what if the customer is new to an area and cannot easily\nidentify the locations we’re suggesting? Could we do more?\n\nOf course we could.\n\nUp until recently, pickup points showed up as map pins on the customer app based\non their location. We decided to add some additional functionality, starting\nwith images.\n\nIf you’re making a booking from an unfamiliar location, or have unreliable GPS\nconnectivity, how do you know you’re at the correct point suggested by the Gojek\napp? By adding images to the corresponding pins, we gave our customers the\nadvantage of being able to visually confirm they were in the right place.\n\nWith the two-factor confirmation of GPS pin and visual, our customers could\nconfirm their pickup point, and wait in peace. Not bad, eh?\n\nAt this point, our app could cater reliably to most of our users, whether it was\nregulars who already had a lot of context on ideal pickup spots or users who\nwere new to an area. However, we wanted to go even further to make a more\nairtight solution. What if a user was near a pickup point, but did not know how\nto reach it?\n\nThis was a problem with significant impact, as a user walking a short distance\nto a nearby well-served pickup point would be significantly faster than a driver\npartner navigating to an unfamiliar location nearby. Driver partners would\npotentially run into obstacles like one ways, or areas in Jakarta where odd-even\nrules are implemented.\n\nHowever, we didn’t want to put the onus of navigating to the PPOI on the user.\nThe least we could do in return for their cooperation was help them with\ndirections.\n\nSo that’s what we did.\n\nBeing able to leverage technology to help users book rides is an achievement in\nitself, one we’re proud of. But stopping at the solution is not how Super Apps\nare built. We exist to solve problems, and then delighting our users further\nthrough ease of use.\n\nFrom vague pickup points defined by often inaccurate GPS pings, our pickup\nexperience had evolved to the point where a user with zero knowledge of an area\ncould easily identify the best location nearby for smooth pickup, understand\nwhether it was convenient to wait at, navigate there, and confirm their arrival\nby sight. Utter delight. ?\n\nThat said, all our bookings don’t happen in dense urban areas with defined\nPPOIs. We’re working towards having PPOIs in most major areas, but sometimes,\ngood old chat-based coordination is still the default fallback.\n\nWe did learn a thing or two from our experience of putting images on PPOIs, so\nwe worked with Gojek’s Platform team (which handles our chat functionality), and\nbaked in the ability to share images in Driver-to-Customer chat. Even if all\nelse fails, our customers could still click a picture of their current location,\nand share it with our partners to help them identify it.\n\nIt’s safe to say that putting in the effort to help our customers get to their\nrides easily has paid off.\n\n> In the areas where we’ve deployed these features, we’ve seen pickup accuracy\ndouble on average. ✌\nWhat’s next?\nThere’s more?\n\nThere’s always more.\n\nEven as we continue to roll out this functionality across more regions we\noperate in, we’re working towards making it better—by allowing our users to give\nus feedback on how accurate our images/directions were, and even upload PPOI\nimages themselves.\n\nWe’ll keep you updated on how we fare.
