We moved from an overwhelming single\npage with too much information, to a more intuitive two-step design with a hope\nthat the new design will help our users navigate the flow better (detailed in \npart two [http://bit.ly/2FUiYDo]).\n\nWe rolled out the design to beta on August 12, 2018.\n\nThis is what our redesigned flow looked like?\n\nOne week later:\nA 10% drop in our orders!!?\n\nThat… did not go according to plan. ?\n\nBut here’s the fun part: The app worked, and the bookings went through. No major\nout-of-whack tech issues. Yet, there we were, steadily losing orders.\n\nBugs? No.\n\nServer issues? Nope.\n\nDowntime, then? Nuh-uh.\n\nAfter many such questions and no answer, we were left with just one conclusion.\n?\n\nThe design change had made things worse.\n\nJust when I thought my job was done, I realised it was only the beginning. For I\nknew, no solution was good enough until users were successfully using it.\n\nStrap in, we’re in the Endgame now ?\nPrior to launch, we had rallied the team around a common definition of success —\none that was quantifiable and easily measured. 10% drop in our orders did seem\ntragic, but we knew looking at a single metric wasn’t going to give us the full\nstory.\n\nHence along with defining success metrics for our overall conversions, we also\ndefined and tracked metrics for the smaller tasks, tasks that led the user to\nthe final goal. This helped us monitor whether users were navigating through the\nflow as intended. As a designer it was important to not restrict myself to just\nwireframes and workflows, but participate and know these numbers inside out.\n\n“Designers who are involved in setting success metrics are far better at driving\nimpact than designers who are not”\n\n— Julie Zhuo\n\nFocusing on post launch productivity ?\nWhen the overall booking rate dropped, we started digging deeper to find where\nthe frictions were in the flow. We started sifting through the finer details and\nclosely analysed the smaller tasks, the results were a bit surprising.\n\n * By moving the location card to the top, our cancellation rate for wrong\n   address selected dropped by 2% —First win☝️\n * There was no significant drop in the notes or dishes added to the cart. Much\n   to our relief, the new interface was intuitive, users were able to locate the\n   notes button and other dish details— Second win ✌️\n * Similar affirmative results with our payments and location card designs too — \n   More wins! ?\n * But, there was one issue. Most users who abandoned the flow, left it on the\n   first step itself. Which meant nearly 8% of users did not even land on the\n   second step of the redesigned flow — Big Loss ?\n\nOur sanest conclusion was to wait, and give our users some time to get a hang of\nthe new designs. After all, old habits die hard. Thousands of our users who were\npreviously used to a single step now had to break a solid habit.\n\nYes, the old design was unacceptable (well, in the designer world at least ?).\nThe new design — despite featuring enhanced UX — broke some habits for our\nusers.\n\nA week passed… then two…\n\nNothing changed. ️\n\nAfter shuffling through tons of data, we found ourselves with a bunch of\nquestions. Who were the users who abandoned their food at checkout? What were\nthey thinking? Why would they do this?\n\nTo get these answered we coupled our quantitative data with some qualitative\nresearch — below are some crude user thoughts ?\n\nThere were two major problems:\n\n 1. Previously used to a single step, users weren’t prepared for a step 2.\n\n2. Most users added only 1–2 dishes, and for them the blank white space meant\nloading. Resulting in high uncertainty and agitation ?\n\nHence, most of them were reluctant to click on NEXT with the fear of placing the\norder — without them knowing the payment method or location ?\n\nWe were evidently drowning, but before we called for the lifebuoy, we tried to\nswim up ourselves. Not ready to give up on our precious designs, we decided to\nbring down the uncertainty by changing the copy on the button to Proceed To Pay.\nWe hoped this would nudge users to realise there is a step 2 containing payment\ninformation.\n\n\nThe Hail Mary play.Did it work? Did the uncertainty drop?\n\nMuch to our despair…nothing changed, no major impact. Neither were we able to\nbring down the booking time, nor were we able to increase the conversion rate.\nNot even close to what we anticipated.\n\nMurder your darlings ??\nWe had to be more open minded. If most of our users seemed unhappy with the\ndesign. we simply had to change it, Period ✋. It was time to hit the dashboards,\nanalyse the problems, and form new ideas for improvements. With the growing\nnumbers, one thing was clear, users wanted to bring back the single page.\n\nFor our final solution we shifted from logic to emotion, focusing more on user’s\nthoughts and feelings at the time of ordering.\n\nI asked myself, if I were a user and I had to know three things about my order,\nwhat would those be? ? — Card sorting came in super handy\n\n * Location Card — I want my food to come to me. I am hungry and the last thing\n   I want is my food going to someone else ?. With a drop in the cancellation\n   rate forwrong address selected, we knew retaining location card at the top\n   worked like magic.\n * Dish Card — If I am craving for a pizza, I better order the right pizza. \n   Right below the location card was the dish card, helping users easily double\n   check the dishes they added ?\n * Total amount and mode of payment — Once I get my pizza, I don’t want to run\n   around looking for cash. By sticking the total amount and payment method with\n   the order button at bottom of the screen, we saved our users a long scroll.\n   This also created a neat space to surface discounts and savings ?\n\nThe final design was a single page with all three important fields (location,\ndish and payment) above the fold and easily accessible. An example of how it\nworked ?\n\nThese lightweight and progressive changes, helped our users cultivate new habits\nslowly and steadily, making the redesign bearable for them ?\n\nShipping — Climbing back onto the boat ?‍♀️\nWe were finally ready to roll, no leap of faith this time!\n\nOn September 5, 2018. We rolled out our final solution to ~50k users, without\nrolling back any of the previous designs. We now had three designs live with\nthree different user groups.\n\n * Group 1 — Control Group (users with existing designs i.e. long scroll)\n * Group 2 — Two-step checkout redesign\n * Group 3 — Single step redesign\n\nSuch a meaty chance to dissect and compare quantitative results. ? It helped me\nstudy and analyse the impact of all three designs against each other.\n\nA day passed…\n\nThen two…\n\nThen a week or three later\n\nWe checked the data, ran the numbers, and validated our original hypothesis.\n\nIt had worked ?\n\nThe simplified single page was stabilising the order graph. Soon, our booking\nrate was moving north (obviously not in a dramatic way), but it had gone up by\n~5% and we saw a significant drop in the booking time.\n\n\nThese lightweight and progressive changes, helped our users cultivate new habits\nslowly and steadily, making the redesign bearable for them ?\n\nShipping — Climbing back onto the boat ?‍♀️\nWe were finally ready to roll, no leap of faith this time!\n\nOn September 5, 2018.
