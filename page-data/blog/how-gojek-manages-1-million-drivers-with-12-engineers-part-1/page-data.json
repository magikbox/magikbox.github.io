It’s a holy tree whose branches touch the heavens.\nThe gods hold court beneath Yggdrasil — debating the fates of other gods, men\nand monsters. It’s the tree of life and the centre of everything in Norse\nmythology. In GOJEK, think of the `Allocations` team as this eternal green ash\ntree.

But how do they do it? This is their story.\n\nOn planet Earth, problems galore\nWhen GOJEK started in 2010, it all began with a call centre. Customers would\ncall a number, the call centre would ‘allocate’ a driver after looking at an\nExcel sheet of drivers in the roster. Our CEO Nadiem Makarim was the first\nperson to test the app built for drivers and customers. As soon as a dummy order\nwas created and Nadiem got the first notification, GOJEK was open for business.\n\nAt its peak in 2014, GOJEK had 200 drivers. The 3-person engineering team had a\nbasic stop-gap model of matchmaking between a driver and a customer. This\ncodebase had to be reworked to match scale. The new matchmaking codebase was\nbuilt in two days and could handle about 700 drivers. It was all manual and\nsomething had to be done to automate\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/how-we-do-what-we-do-at-go-jek-tech-d1d5d952e13] \nthe whole process.\n\nIn the beginning of 2015, a version of the app was launched to keep pace with\nincreasing demand. GO-RIDE, GO-FOOD and GO-SEND went live. Customers would ‘bid’\nfor a driver, drivers would get a notification, accept a drive and voila, we’re\ngood to go. This was the birth of the ‘bid engine’ — a classic matchmaker\nbetween supply and demand: Driver and Customer. It would form the genesis on\nwhich GOJEK was going to be built. The problem: siloed boxes.\n\nThere were a total of three products with the same underlying infrastructure,\nbut no interconnectedness.

This problem is further pronounced\nwhen you realise all three teams were working on the same infrastructure.\n\nImportantly, GOJEK simply wasn’t prepared to handle the kind of adoption and\ngrowth the company began to witness as soon as the app was launched.\n\nThe algorithm started to crumble. The engineering was pretty straightforward\nwith 10–15 lines of code, and solved problems for a small set of data. As the\ndrivers increased, downtimes became a routine affair. There were way too many\nbottlenecks. GOJEK was failing, and fast.\n\nSoon, Sequoia had mutual investment portfolios and unlocked some doors. Sidu\nPonnappa, our current India Head, then the CEO of CodeMonk, travelled to\nIndonesia to pick between three of Sequoia’s companies.
