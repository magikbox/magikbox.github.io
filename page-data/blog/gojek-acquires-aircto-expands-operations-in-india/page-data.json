We have looked at multiple ways to expand our operations and concluded\nthat Gurgaon is a logical destination to set up shop, not least because of the\namazing talent we have found in the area. GOJEK recorded an annualized Gross\nTransaction Value (GTV) of US$9 billion as of 2018, and the hyper-growth journey\nwe’ve been on demands talent who are willing to take risks, fail, learn and\ncontinue to scale a company that aims to solve everyday problems for Southeast\nAsia. With operations underway in Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, we will now\nconsider whether further acquisitions are needed as we seek to bring in\nentrepreneurial teams who can help us further develop the multi-service business\nmodel that makes GOJEK a leader in Southeast Asia,” said Sidu Ponnappa, MD India\nat GOJEK.\n\nOn the acquisition of AirCTO, Sidu added, “I’m super thrilled to have AirCTO’s\ntalented team join us. The team will use technology to help us scale up our\nhiring processes. Finding quality talent is always a challenge, and Atif and\nteam are here to find technology-based solutions that will help us to overcome\nthis challenge.”\n\nAtif Haider, Founder, AirCTO, said, “At AirCTO we’ve focused on the pain points\ntechnology firms experience as they seek to find talent that fits their\nrequirements. We believe that recruiting as an industry needs a major upheaval,\nand we started AirCTO with this in mind. Over the past three years, we’ve helped\na range of startups and corporates source qualified candidates for critical\ntechnology roles. We were in talks with a number of other tech giants, but we\nfound GOJEK to be the best fit, as we share similar DNA — something that’s\nreally important for us. We intend to use our prowess in recruitment to\ncontribute to the hyper-growth GOJEK is currently experiencing across Southeast\nAsia.”\n\nLocated at DLF CyberHub, Gurgaon, the 18,000+ sq.ft office is equipped to seat\naround 150+ employees. The centre offers all amenities including a 24/7 office\nwith a cafeteria. The interiors reflect GOJEK’s signature combination of green\nand white with a touch of wood. The office will be a combination of open spaces,\nbreakout areas for discussions, meeting rooms and coder caves.\n\nThe GOJEK Bangalore office recently won an Institute of Indian Interior\nDesigners (IIID) award for the ‘Best Design’ category.\n\nAs part of the expansion, GOJEK’s largest India-based product team, GO-FOOD,\nwill setup product divisions in the Gurgaon office. GOJEK is the largest\nsingle-market food delivery app in the world outside of China. It is the largest\nfood delivery app in SoutheastAsia with over 400,000 merchants — 85% of these\nare small micro-entrepreneurs that rely heavily on GO-FOOD for revenue.\n\nWorking at GOJEK gives an opportunity to solve real challenges and transform\nlives across Southeast Asia. Earlier this year, Melinda Gates, Co-Chair of the\nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation\n[https://twitter.com/gojektech/status/1095372174070665216], called out GOJEK’s\nuse of technology as a case study on how digital tools can help increase growth\nand inclusion.
