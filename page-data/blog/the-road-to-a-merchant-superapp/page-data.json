GoFood — Gojek’s food\ndelivery product — lists 400,000+ merchants. You search for the outlet you want\nto order from, select the item and quantity, check out, and pay either via cash\nor Gojek’s digital wallet GoPay. Then, you sit back and watch the little Gojek\ndriver partner on the screen zoom their way to the restaurant, and bring you\nsome fried banana goodness. 😍\n\nSimple. Fast. Reliable.\n\n> Rewind a few years, and things didn’t look so good.\nFirst, some context\nWhen GoFood launched in 2015, expansion and adoption happened rapidly. The\norders started piling in, and we were struggling to keep up with demand.\nInitially, we’d simply list food merchants on our marketplace, send demand their\nway, and fulfil it through our fleet of driver partners.\n\nWe were building for our consumers and driver partners, but merchants were\nalways a key component of our ecosystem. If Gojek is an iceberg, the\nconsumer-facing Super App is the part above water. In this story, we’ll dive\nbeneath the surface to explore another key component — GoBiz, our merchant\nSuperApp.\n\n> But before GoBiz, there was GoResto.\nThe Merchant Problem\nIf we had ordered ourselves that pisang goreng in the early days of GoFood,\nthings would have worked very differently.\n\nYou see, merchants were onboarded by the GoFood team by uploading their menus to\nour systems. We’d look through these menus to find our fried banana of choice,\nand make an order, which would be relayed directly to a driver partner. This\npartner would then go to the restaurant and place the order (which is when the\nmerchant partner gets involved in the process).\n\nSo, while our bananas are fried, the driver partner would wait around, and when\nthe order is ready, pay in cash. The problem with this approach was that there\nwas no record of the transaction besides a booking on GoFood and a receipt\nhanded to the driver partner.\n\nThis was an inefficient system, for driver partners, and our customers.\n\n> Oh, and those merchants? Things weren’t rosy for them either.\nLet’s assume our pisang goreng place is a GoFood partner (meaning Gojek collects\ncommissions for the increased demand we send their way), and also part of a\nlarger chain. When we place the order, GoFood will assign it to one outlet of\nthe chain. However, our driver partner may decide to visit another outlet and\npick up the order from there.\n\nAt the end of the month, our restaurant partners would be invoiced for\ncommission that was due to us, based on sales as reported by the GoFood app.\nThis meant we were charging some merchants commission for sales their outlet may\nhave never made.\n\nWe spent a lot of time and resources addressing merchant complaints. 🤦‍♂️\n\n> Then there was the matter of control.\nIf a merchant partner was not open for business on a particular day, wanted to\nupdate their menu, or indicate items as out of stock, they had to call Gojek\nCustomer Care. During this time, orders might still be coming in.\n\nLet’s just say we weren’t doing ourselves any favours. 🤷🏻‍♂️\n\nThere was a lot that needed fixing here, and it could only be done by\nintegrating merchants more deeply into our ecosystem. So that’s what we did.\n\nThe birth of GoResto\nTowards the end of 2016, a concept was developed for an app that would cater to\nGoFood merchant partners, and by early 2017 GoResto — which is what we called it\nat the time — was ready. You can read more about the product research process\nthat went into making GoResto here\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/whats-cooking-diving-into-kitchens-for-go-biz-e01051bfdc98]\n).\n\nWith GoResto, we addressed some of the problems outlined earlier.\n\n1. Electronic payments\nAll of Gojek’s driver partners had GoPay e-wallets associated with their\naccounts. With GoResto, we did the same for GoFood merchants. Transactions\nbetween driver and merchant partners would now be wallet-to-wallet, not cash.\nGojek would deduct any applicable commission immediately from the merchant\nwallet. This made the reconciliation process with merchants simpler.\n\n2. PIN exchange for restaurant verification\nTo eliminate fraud, driver partners would also need to share a PIN with the\nmerchant while picking up the order. This electronic handshake helped us verify\nthey were indeed picking up the right order from the right outlet.\n\nIt was a decent solution. If all went according to plan, we could breathe easy.\n\n> As you might have guessed, all did not go according to plan. 🙇‍♂️\nIn the first iteration, the wallet creation process required collaboration with\nthe GoPay team, which was itself facing bandwidth constraints due to rapid\ngrowth (which we’ll talk about a little later).\n\nAlso, the merchant onboarding to GoResto at this point was still a manual\nprocess. In our first month, we onboarded only 26 merchants. 😣\n\nWe needed a more scalable solution.\n\nHere’s a quick note on Gojek company culture. When the chips are down, it’s\nimportant for organisations to have core values to guide decision-making. One of\nour values happens to be:\n\nThis line is an affirmation to all stakeholders to take the best decision for a\nparticular situation based on available information. Such decisions are then\nrespected by everyone else.\n\nWe made two drastic decisions:\n\n 1. Merchant onboarding was completely frozen until we could build a platform to\n    automate the process.\n 2. Engineers from the Merchants team were embedded within GoPay, building\n    required capacities on GoPay systems while core GoPay engineers continued\n    work on scaling the platform.\n\n> In three months, as summer rolled around, GoResto was back.\nWe weren’t out of the woods yet though. All this was happening before Gojek had\ndeprecated its legacy codebase, Stan Marsh\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/thank-you-stan-marsh-29db553544bf], in favour\nof microservices, so system stability was not exactly excellent. As a result, we\nstill faced sync issues between GoFood and GoResto order management systems.\nThis, in turn, began to reflect on us publicly.\n\nOur app store rating at this point slid down to 3.2.\n\nMake It Work, Then Make It Better\nWe clearly had a long way to go to make GoResto the app our merchants deserved.\nThings were bad, but as they say — sometimes the only way out is through.\n\nChallenge accepted. 💪\n\nFirst things first, we went about fixing the sync issues by building a second\nsystem to replace our unreliable version. Not only was this accomplished, but\nall onboarded merchants were migrated to the new system, with zero downtime. \nRead more about how this was done in this post\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/zero-downtime-traffic-migration-at-go-food-17ba413eb8c2]\n.\n\n> One small win.\nNow for the real problems, giving merchants the control they needed over how\nthey were represented on GoFood. The first self-serve feature we introduced to\nGoResto was allowing merchants to update their restaurant status in real time.\n\n> Another small win.\nWe had unlocked a critical component in product design — empathy for the people\nyou’re building for. The question now was — what can we do that will make life\neasier for our merchants?\n\nItem availability? Understood.\nMenu updation? Got it.\nPricing adjustments? Why not.\nAdd categories? Move items between categories? Update images?\n\n> Done, done… and done. ✅\nOur systems were stable, early teething troubles were addressed, we were finally\nsolving the problems that needed solving.\n\nBuild It Right, And They Will Come\nAs GoResto grew in functionality, we began\n\n slowly earning back the goodwill of our merchant community. Soon, our app store\nrating began to reflect that.\n\nApp store ratings reflecting how customer goodwill can be earned back ✌️We\ndidn’t need to push GoResto to merchants anymore, it was adopted due to the ease\nof doing business it offered.\n\n> It was long overdue, but we had accomplished what we had set out to do. There\nwas finally a moment to sit back and enjoy the sunrise.\nOr so we thought.\n\nThe rest was short-lived. Southeast Asia was abuzz with activity. According to\nthis report\n[https://www.blog.google/documents/47/SEA_Internet_Economy_Report_2019.pdf], the\nvalue of the Internet economy in the region tripled in the years since 2015. The\nGross Merchandise Value (GMV) projection for 2025 is estimated to be $300\nbillion.\n\n> To put that in perspective — in 2016, that projection was $100 billion.\nEven as GoResto was being built, there was another behemoth stirring under the\nrich waters of Indonesia’s digital payments landscape. GoPay, which had been\nrapidly growing in this favourable environment since its arrival in 2016, was\nnow being used by roughly three-quarters of digital payments users in Indonesia.\n\nBut we wanted more.\n\nIn 2018, GoPay introduced offline acceptance, bringing a whole new category of\nmerchant partners into our ecosystem.\n\n> Our existing solution wasn’t good enough anymore. It was time to evolve.\nKeep watching this space for the continued story charting GoResto’s evolution\ninto our full-fledged merchants platform — GoBiz.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant our updates beamed straight to your inbox?
