The goal: Create a cohesive visual language for a #SuperApp that\ndoes everything, and help millions understand the brand and its identity.\n\nThe objective of this post is to help aspiring designers who want to join us in\naccomplishing this mission understand our hiring process better.\n\n> But first, allow us a round of introductions.\nWe are a group of about 100 people, spread across two countries; Indonesia\n(Jakarta) and India (Bangalore). and five teams â€” Communication Design, Writing,\nDesign Operations, Interaction Design, and Product Design.\n\nWe work very closely with different functions and products in the organisation,\nand go to great lengths to make sure we deliver a world-class experience to our\nusers.\n\n> Now that you have some context, letâ€™s get down to business.\nA glimpse from a Product Design case studyOur hiring process consists of\nmultiple steps:\n\n1. Connect with recruiters\nOne of many things our Design Operations team puts focus on is hiring. We have\ntwo channels for applications that you can connect with: our website careers\npage [https://www.gojek.io/all-open-positions?d=design]. We receive a number of\napplications every day, and the ones that catch our attention are the ones that\nprovide a structured portfolio and display a strong motivation to join us. It\nusually takes 48 hours for us to analyse your profile and get back to you.\n\n2. A friendly telephonic conversation\nIf we like what we see on your profile, we will invite you for a 15â€“30 minute\nphone call with one of our recruiters. This will revolve around the Design Team\nitself, the opportunity we have available, and our expectation of the role.\nHowever, do remember this conversation goes both ways. Besides learning about\nyou and your design experiences, weâ€™d love to hear about your aspirations, and\nthe expectations you have of us.\n\n3. Portfolio review\nThis is why having a solid portfolio is paramount. We involve 4â€“5 of our\ndesigners to review it, based on the attributes that we prioritise. This is an\nimportant stage, so please make sure you build a structured and detailed\nportfolio that highlights your approach to arrive at your eventual design. Donâ€™t\nforget to enclose your designs which are live in production! You can usually\nexpect a response from us within three days in most cases.\n\n4. Portfolio call\nSeeing the designs is one thing, but understanding the thought process behind it\nis equally important to us. To understand this better, we set up a 60 minute\ncall with 5 of our designers, during the course of which you can take us through\nyour portfolio. Do pick one or two of your most interesting projects. Your\nthinking process and problem-solving capability should be the focus, along with\nhow you measure your design results and the impact it brings.\n\n5. Solving a problem with the Gojek Design Team in a collaborative environment\nIf you pass the portfolio call with a positive result, you will be invited to\nthe Gojek office for a three-hour collaborative problem-solving session.\n\nThis process allows us to give you more context on how we solve problems. For\nus, the only way to evaluate how good a designer you are is by doing an exercise\ntogether. Gojek style â€” case study session!\n\nA brainstorming session with Gojek Design panels.The onsite case study session\nconsists of a mini design sprint and brainstorming time.\n\n> Donâ€™t let all this stress you out though, we are not expecting absolute\nperfection here.\nThe idea is to collaborate and solve a problem together. Focus on the problem,\nnot the solution. Drawing a wireframe is easy, but what is the solution and how\nyou approach it is more important to us. Believe in yourself, there are no\nuniversal truths here.\n\nProblem-solving in the onsite case study session.6. Bar raiser\nIf youâ€™ve reached this stage, you definitely have the skills. Now, itâ€™s time to\nevaluate how well you fit in at Gojek in general. To evaluate this, youâ€™ll meet\nour Head of Design. Now that you have gained context from our technical rounds,\nwe will discuss your expectation from us once again.\n\n> Also, as always, feel free to ask questions. ðŸ™‚\nThis is our last interview round, so take a breather. We will usually let you\nknow the result in one day. If all goes according to plan, this entire process\nshould be completed within two to three weeks. The last step will involve us\nmaking an offer â€” which means we are ready to have you on the team.\nCongratulations! ðŸ™Œ ðŸ’š\n\nSo, do we sound like the kind of team youâ€™d like to be a part of?
