If you haven’t\nread part one, get up to speed here.\n\nPart 2/3 | Initiation\nWhen we left Trifecta — the team responsible for charting GOJEK’s international\nexpansion — in the last part of this series, the team was working on setting up\na new environment for launch in Vietnam. But now, there were new problems to\ntackle.\n\nProblem #1: Configuration drift\n\nUntil this point, GOJEK had always operated within Indonesia, but Trifecta was\nnow in unmapped territory, building a completely new environment for GOJEK’s\nservices in Vietnam. The services now needed to be configured separately across\ngeographies, and there was no central location to manage these configurations\neffectively. This meant there was a chance of configuration inconsistencies\ncreeping in over time (hence the term ‘drift’).\n\nProblem #2: Deployment drift\n\nEven if the team hacked a solution for the first problem, deploying the code\nwould pose another one. It was imperative that the same version of code run on\nall the environments (the existing one in Indonesia, the one being built for\nVietnam, and any future ones). Failing this, supporting services across\ncountries would be a nightmare.\n\n> That wasn’t the kind of risk a startup that expounds lean engineering could\nafford to take.\nProblem #3: A logging and monitoring solution for the Kubernetes cluster.\n\nAs this was the first time containers were being used by GOJEK, a new logging\nsolution would be required for future debugging needs.\n\nMuch time had been lost already, it was time to bring in the big guns.\n\nEven as the team dodged obstacles and took detours, making the best use of\navailable resources, Project Managers Sourabh Gupta and Sanchit Juneja had been\ncommunicating with other teams for backup. They had found some ad-hoc support,\nbut to see this journey through would need more seasoned soldiers.\n\nFinally, this effort came to fruition.\n\nTrifecta V2.0\nAfter some negotiation, the team got the go-ahead for Sumit Gupta, another GOJEK\nveteran, to make the transition from GOJEK’s Atlas team to join Trifecta full\ntime. Sumit had led GOJEK’s scaling efforts back in 2015, when the company was\nin constant firefighting mode, and knew a thing or two about dealing with the\nkind of situation the team was in. He would now assume the role of Trifecta’s\nTech Lead.\n\nWith a renewed sense of purpose, the team looked back at the roadmap and\nreassessed priorities. This would be a challenging project. Daunting, yes.\nInsurmountable? Not quite.\n\n> If you’ve read GOJEK’s essential reading list\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/the-go-jek-reading-list-1088712ccc14], you\nmay have noticed that The Mythical Man Month is one of the books we swear by,\nand one of its core tenets is: “Adding more people to a late software project\nmakes it later.”\n> We added four more engineers to the team.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDimensions and distant visions\nGOJEK did not have previously devised solutions for the drifts it was dealing\nwith. It needed new ones.\n\nTackling configuration drift.\n\nIt would now be Trifecta’s job to create a location within which services for\ndifferent environments could be configured and accessed.\n\nThe solution was a service that used a new API to update configurations across\ngeographies. These were then migrated to a configuration store.\n\nThis store was named Yggdrasil, the mythical Norse tree that connects the nine\nrealms. Even in the frenzied sprint to accomplish a daunting task, we could\nnever resist the temptation of poetic nomenclature. 😅\n\n> Yggdrasil changed how configs were stored and managed in GOJEK.\nTackling deployment drift\n\nCode.\n\nCode fuels GOJEK, and ensuring that updated code is running in sync is one of\nthe primary objectives of any team. Trifecta was no different — except for\nscale.\n\nThe team needed to figure out a way to ensure that the same version of code ran\nacross multiple, disconnected environments. It was time to forge a new\naccessory.\n\n> A Palantir — a seeing stone.\nWhen new versions of an application are released, there is a need to deploy the\nsame version on all countries for the given environment. Palantir would take\ncare of figuring out which countries the given deployment should go to.\n\nThe team also built a UI for Palantir, which gave a view of what version of a\nservice was deployed in which cluster and sent alerts when there was a drift.\n\nTackling the logging problem\n\nAs launch date drew closer, this particular problem required non-linear\nthinking. Trifecta implemented an out-of-the-box solution using Stackdriver to\nunblock themselves for the launch. This was not optimal, but it provided enough\nbreathing room to get through launch (post which specific tooling for logging on\ncontainers could be created).\n\nOnce again, the destination appeared near. With Yggdrasil keeping the services\nstable and Palantir keeping watch on code, GO-VIET was no longer a wistful\ndream, it was a visible apparition.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRun with Red\nIf you visit Indonesia, chances are you’ll see bright flecks of green amidst the\ntraffic.\n\n> Green jackets, green helmets, green… everywhere. Green is now part of GOJEK’s\nidentity in Indonesia, it is instant mental recall for the brand.\n> But this was not Indonesia.\n> GO-VIET, it was decided, would be born in red.\nA local leadership team was put together in order to assemble other teams\nrequired for launch. This team was also flown to Jakarta to understand GOJEK’s\nvalues and how it works. These would serve as the core values for GO-VIET as\nwell, with the leadership adapting things as required to suit Vietnam.\n\nMeanwhile, Trifecta was stabilising the launch environment, collaborating with\nthe newly-minted team in Vietnam, and working with multiple GOJEK teams.\n\nBy June of 2018, the backend was ready. A working driver and consumer app, as\nwell as on-boarding portals for driver partners had been set up, along with\ncrucial business-related teams like BI and Fraud. GO-VIET was taking shape right\nin front of its makers’ eyes.\n\n> Now for the testing:\nOver the next one month, the app, and by extension, the new environment and\nassorted services, were put through the wringer. First, employees mocking as\ndrivers tried it in a staging environment, then the actual on-boarded drivers\nwere given a shot, so the team could record their feedback.\n\nTesting then moved to the production environment. It was time for the real deal.\nThe dry runs began, and in the final phase of testing, early adopters were given\naccess to try out the alpha version of the app.\n\nFinally, it was done. The environment, the services, the app, the operations,\nthe tree, the stone… they had all survived.\n\n> GO-VIET was ready.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe final push\nJuly 31, 2018 — Vietnam Beckoned\n\nThe environment was ready, everything was up and running. The app was live, with\nconfigurations changed so drivers would not be visible to anyone who downloaded\nit.\n\nGearing up for launch.At 11.30 pm, the toggle was switched and test bookings\nwere made on production with actual drivers and employees. The GO-VIET COO took\nthe first ride. All was good.\n\nExcitement was running high, and even GOJEK CEO Nadiem Makarim was in Ho-Chi\nMinh City (the first of GO-VIET’s operation centres) for the launch.\n\nAs the clock struck midnight, Trifecta hit the button, and specks of red lit up\non the map within users’ GO-VIET apps.
