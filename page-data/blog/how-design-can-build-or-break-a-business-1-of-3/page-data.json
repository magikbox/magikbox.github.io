The largest food delivery service in\nSoutheast Asia, 300,000+ merchants, 16 million menu items… you get the drift.\nWith figures like that, you’d expect the GoFood user experience to be the best\nin the business.\n\nWhy then, did nearly 20% of GoFood users leave the checkout flow after adding\nitems to their cart?\n\nSomething wasn’t adding up.\n\nOur user flow was broken, and we needed to fix it.\n\nTL;DR: This post is part one of a three-part series highlighting the case study\nand critical considerations that went into redesigning the Checkout experience\nfor GoFood — Gojek’s food delivery product.\n\nLights, Camera… ??\nGOJEK was going through a major facelift in 2018. For a Super App with 19+\nproducts, we had all the scale-related issues one could imagine. We desperately\nneeded an efficient system for our designers and developers. This gave birth to \nAsphalt — GOJEK’s very own Design Language System [http://asphalt.gojek.io/].\n\nThe redesign started with our transport app — GoRide. It was then time to show\nsome love to Gojek’s prodigal child — GoFood. The product owner walked up to to\nme and said — “Let’s go beyond just the UI, and rethink the entire user\nexperience, instead of ceding over features as is.”\n\nWhat he meant — “Get ready! Lots of sleepless nights coming your way. We’re\ngoing to do a mammoth redesign, the likes of which minions like you will crumble\nunder.” ?\n\n? Action!\nWe wanted our redesign to solve problems with specific business constraints, and\nwe knew it was impossible to do so without delving into user problems first.\n\nFinding the right problem to solve is harder (and more important) than finding\nthe right solution.\n\nFirst comes the framework\nTo achieve this, we pinned some critical thumb-rules before embarking on our\nredesign journey:\n\n * To be data-driven. (“Design is not about making things pretty” — I’m going to\n   parrot this line 10 times over in this blog and if you ever talk to me?)\n * To incorporate the existing brand perception into all designs. (Marketing\n   says fun and creative but product looks dull and boring?Problem!)\n * To empathise with users and business requirements. (Always chase the full\n   story, be user-centric and business-driven)\n\nTo put the framework to use, we started white-boarding our in-app user flow. In\nthe journey graph, we noticed a large number of users were dropping-off at our\ncheckout page. That means nearly 20% of our users who added items to their cart,\nleft the flow right before placing the order (the last step) — the checkout page\n\nWe summed up the results to visually represent the emotional state of our in-app\nuser journey.Understand users’ pain points ?\nThe second step was to understand our users’ pain points with the existing UX in\nthe checkout flow. To dig deeper into this, we reached out to our users directly\n(kudos to the research team for setting this up). We adapted both qualitative\nand quantitative methods to get to the root of every problem in the picture. We\nthen accumulated all our learnings into a consumer journey infographic.\n\nUser journey map | Courtesy: GoFood research team :)We wanted to involve the\nwhole GoFood team, beyond just research and design. This made it more\ncollaborative than the traditional sharing and feedback loop. To reinforce this,\nwe conducted several internal sharing and brainstorming sessions. The research\nteam also put together a fun quiz for user personas.\n\nInternal brainstorming sessions — Researchers, Engineers, Designers, PMs & UX\nwriters.What were the results?\n\nAs anticipated, our users felt agitated, confused and overwhelmed, resulting in\na big drop off at the Checkout page. Here’s some of the feedback from our users:\n\n“I find this step too confusing.”\n\n“A lot of times my order button is disabled (grey) and I don’t know why.”\n\n“I often miss rechecking some information at this step, most times I only focus\non payment.”\n\nThis entire process was important for us — to be able to go to the field, do\ninterviews, research, and speak to our customers directly. It gave us tremendous\ninsight into the product development, and is precisely what made our product so\ngood. This was not only fun but extremely useful.\n\nWith all the research and data at our disposal; we realised that redesigning the\ncheckout flow first will not only enhance the user experience, but help solve a\ncritical business problem.\n\n\nNeeds a lot of ❤, doesn’t it?The original page consists of five components on one single page. It was\nextremely overwhelming for most of our users:\n\n 1. Dish Details and Notes card\n\n2. Delivery Location Selection card\n\n3. Payment Method Selection card\n\n4. Voucher card\n\n5. Billing & Discounts card\n\nHats off to our users for being patient. I say this because every time a user\nlands on this page, they had to process a verbose set of information, and\nperform countless actions in a single page to just ‘confirm’ one food order.\nPainful. ?\n\nDesign is integral. Design is sacrosanct. While companies are now paying heed to\nthe importance of design, GOJEK, by virtue of being a #SuperApp, had to imbibe\ndesign logic into its very fabric.\n\nSo we got to work.\n\nDefining each problem ⚡️\nOnce we dissected the users’ goals and pain points, we had a clear picture of\nall the problems that plagued the Checkout flow. We narrowed our learnings to \nfive primary user problems to form a common understanding of what we were trying\nto solve.\n\nProblem 1: Verbose Information\nThe first thing most users did on this page was scroll, scroll and scroll. 3\nscrolls minimum. Also, did you notice the amount of text? We’re in the age of\nmicro-blogging and us millennials have the attention span of goldfishes, for\ncrying out loud!\n\nProblem 2: Cognitive overload\nThe page was overflowing with tasks that required explicit actions from the\nuser. Do this. And that. And hey, this too. Oh wait, THAT TOO. Chaotic. Select\ndelivery location but first find where it is, check the total, select payment\nmethod, glance through all the dishes added to the cart, apply your discount\nvoucher….?\n\nProblem 3: Prolonged Checkout\nToo many actions and redundant information caused users to spend more than 2\nminutes just to confirm and place a simple order. Time wasted, energy wasted,\ntummy still not fed. ?\n\nProblem 4: High Cancellations\nA large sum of our users hurried through this step without actually\ndouble-checking delivery location details (buried under a scroll somewhere).\nThis resulted in nearly 3% of our users cancelling and reordering the same cart\nwith an updated address (that’s another story in itself).\n\nProblem 5: Lacks Love\nThere was nothing delightful about this page. The dishes didn’t have images on\ncheckout, the icons weren’t consistent, and had too much clutter. It was just\ntext and buttons stacked in the form of black and white cards. No, seriously,\neven the active ‘Add more items’ button was a plain grey.\n\nIn a nutshell, our flow lacked information hierarchy, delight, structure, was\ntoo complex, and in all… poor.\n\nIn order to fix this, we spent a month researching, ideating, and defining the\nproblem. Then we ideated some more, deliberated, chugged way too much beer (to\nadd some philosophical thinking), and tried to justify one solution after\nanother with the right data and metrics.\n\nWe were ready. We had all the answers. ?‍♀️\n\nBoy, were we wrong.\n\nIn the next post [http://bit.ly/2FUiYDo], I’ll detail all the steps we took to\narrive at this perfect (lol) solution — and how it all went downhill.","html":"<p>By Fatema Raja</p><p>GoFood needs little by way of introduction.
