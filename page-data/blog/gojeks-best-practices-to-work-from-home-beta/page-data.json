As\ngovernments and authorities encourage social distancing, many companies — Gojek\nincluded — have started to put a heightened emphasis on working from home. As an\norganization with a distributed workforce, we have offices in Indonesia,\nSingapore, Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines, and India, a remote strategy has\nalways been embedded in our DNA. This post details some lessons and what we\nthink are ‘best practices’ to follow in a Work from home (WFH) situation.\n\nAt the outset, it’s important to call out a key point: During this time of\nuncertainty, employees may not be at their productive best. There’s a lot of\nanxiety with family and friends, and rightly so. WFH requires high \nAccountability, but also Empathy and Trust. Be mindful, this is a stressful time\nfor everyone. Trust your colleagues to do the best they can given the times.\n\nBefore we begin — context\nGojek has always been mindful of our employees’ health and wellbeing. We have\nunlimited sick leaves, and encourage employees to work where and when they are\nat their productive best. We have proven success — with functional leaders\nworking fully remotely without compromising on effectively launching org-wide\ninitiatives: career ladders, new hiring programs, even setting up an entire new\nfunction. But this is by all means not a comprehensive or a definitive guide.\nThink of this as a ‘beta’ document summarising some lessons in a bid to get\nfeedback from you, our readers. We’re putting this out there so we can learn\ntogether to do better.\n\nIf you think we’ve missed out on something, please leave a comment — will help\nus a long way in fine-tuning our own practices. These are trying times, and we\nwant to do what is right for everyone.\n\n(1)The right environment\nOffice spaces provide designated areas employees start associating with work and\nfocus. This may not be the case in a home environment, so it is important to\nrecreate this space. Some ideal prerequisites include an area with plenty of\nlight, minimal distractions and a comfortable desk and chair.\n\nWorking from home also potentially involves sharing the space with other family\nmembers / housemates. It’s important to set guidelines to indicate when you are\nat work and not to be disturbed — one team member for example set up a plush toy\non a desk as a makeshift ‘Do Not Disturb’ sign!\n\nOnce a setup is established, don’t neglect the importance of taking breaks. The\nabsence of colleagues and social interaction should not lead to long\nuninterrupted sessions. Set a timer to alert you if you’ve been continuously at\nyour desk for over two hours. Take short breaks to stretch your legs. Use the\ntime to also spend time with family, or work on personal projects that require\nthe occasional check-in! There’s a silver lining to every scenario :)\n\nThis whole point might seem obvious and rather trivial, but is critical when you\nwant focus, and don’t have your colleagues to ‘pair’ with you and nudge you.\n\n(2) The right tools\nEnsure the coordination tools used by your organisation / team are installed on\nyour laptop and working properly. At Gojek we use Slack for messaging, Zoom for\nvideo conferencing, and Asana and JIRA for project coordination. Here are a few\nquick tips from our WFH Best Practices\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TPAKV-AowBpODVul5cL73mKN5caN6RQf0wvV_6O5Ees/edit?usp=sharing] \non how best to use them in a remote work scenario:\n\nOver communicate: Set clear expectations and create WFH Rules of Engagement for\nyour team. What cadences need to be synchronous vs. async? Set your Slack status\nto away every time you leave the computer for a break, and update it once you’re\nback. Clearly request responses to critical communications you send, and do the\nsame to confirm you’ve received an update (even Slack’s emoji responses will do,\nas long as there is recorded acknowledgement).\n\nDocument everything: Meetings may become increasingly asynchronous, so it is\nimportant to document all the items discussed and assigned. Record key decisions\nin a centralized decision log. This can be done via written notes hosted in a\ncommon cloud folder, as well as tasks on Asana for accountability. Minimise\ncommunication gaps.\n\nChoose the most high-context communication medium available: A lot gets lost in\ntranslation when you don’t have visual cues. Use video conferencing whenever\npossible. Failing video, (spotty connection) default to a phone call, then chat.\nIn chat, don’t hesitate to use emojis liberally to convey your tone! ?\n\nPro tip: In Zoom preferences, set the option to video muted/off as the default —\nthen manually enable them once you join a meeting. It can help avoid a few\nfacepalms. Not everyone has the perfect Instagram workspace at home, so Zoom’s\nbackground masks\n[https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/204674889-Zoom-Rooms-Customized-Background] \nwill help.\n\n(3) The right mindset\nThe shift to remote will be alien for a lot of us. Be respectful and considerate\n— everyone’s doing the best they can. Set up core work hours when the entire\nteam is expected to be available and clearly define these on a calendar. Be\nmindful of each other’s calendars and schedule sensitively so all concerned\nparties can extract the maximum output from their workday.\n\nQuantify what is being done at the end of each day, and by whom. Transparency is\nkey here. You can shape this right at the beginning during daily team meetings.\nWhen social interactions with colleagues are virtual, you as a manager, or an\nemployer, tend to worry about accountability. Maintain a notepad of things you\ndid, what you’re working on, when others can expect work to be delivered, and\nwhen you will respond to messages or requests. This reduces anxiety and helps\nyou plan your day. In the midst of all this, don’t forget to respect your own\ntime as well. Define your working hours, and stop once they are up.\n\nIt’s equally easy to also overwork yourself when working from home. Be mindful\nof your on-screen time.\n\nSnackable hacks\nWe spoke to a bunch of Gojek folks to get some of their actionable WFH hacks:\n\n * If you find your attention span dwindling, take time off, browse your\n   favorite social media app, go for a walk — get that Vitamin D in, talk to a\n   friend/family member etc…\n * Eat on time, eat healthy — set timelines for this on your calendar so you’re\n   not skipping meals.\n * Create a mini-team virtual group just for social interactions that do not\n   discuss work — movies, books, art, interesting articles etc.\n * Hydrate. Stretch every 30 minutes. Hydrate. Have strict timelines on when you\n   eat. Do not sway here. Did we say hydrate? Hydrate.\n * Team calls should start with something fun — a new fact you learnt, an\n   interesting fact you learnt, or something interesting going on in team\n   member’s lives outside of work.\n * Change into a separate set of clothes during core working hours, even if they\n   are just a different set of comfortable PJs. It helps delineate “work time”\n   from “waking up” or “me time” when both are happening in the same place. It’s\n   tempting to work in bed while wearing the clothes you slept in, but avoid\n   this!\n * Your calendar is sacred — set timers for food breaks, leisure walks, time\n   off, family obligations etc.\n * Call out good work! Do this more often than usual and with consistency. Start\n   your meetings with kudos.\n\nWe’re trying to get better\nThis is an important shift in how organisations get work done. While this guide\nis a foundation to help us figure things out, we don’t have all the answers.\n\nIf you have significant experience with remote work\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TPAKV-AowBpODVul5cL73mKN5caN6RQf0wvV_6O5Ees/edit?usp=sharing]\n, we’d like to hear your thoughts. Feel free to drop into our comments.\n\nThat’s all from us for now, stay safe!\n\nP.S.
