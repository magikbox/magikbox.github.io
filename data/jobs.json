People know that you have things under control, whether it’s keeping people on the same page across multiple continents, or coordinating a sensitive launch with multiple department heads.

You are tuned into their motivations and worries, and you use that understanding to compassionately help them overcome obstacles. It’s intuitive for you to read signals that help you decide when to follow up, and when to give space to others. You seek to understand both the business’ point of view and the technical constraints that keep your engineers up at night. You know your strengths, but you own your mistakes and know when to ask for help.",
