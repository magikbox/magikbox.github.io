The recognition is given to\ncompanies that do well by doing good and create a wider socio-economic impact.\n\nThis year, Gojek ranked 11th out of 52 international organizations, making a\nleap from its 17th position in 2017. Gojek is the only Southeast Asian company\nto make it into this year’s Fortune “Change the World” list, recognized for\nGoPay’s innovation in accelerating financial inclusion in Indonesia. Gojek is\nalso the only Southeast Asian company to have received this internationally\nrecognised accolade twice.\n\nGlobal CEO and Founder of Gojek Nadiem Makarim said, “We are humbled to be\nrecognized by Fortune once again, for accomplishing what we have set out to\nachieve from day one — empowering lives and solving problems through technology.\nWe are so thankful to all of our driver partners, merchants, customers, business\npartners, investors, and the government for their continuous support. Our\nstakeholder support is key to Gojek’s success in evolving into an integrated\necosystem with three Super Apps that move people, things, and money.”\n\nThe prominent global list highlights how GoPay, Gojek’s digital payments\nplatform, has helped drive Indonesia’s digital economy by expanding financial\naccess for millions in Indonesia, where 64% of the population is ‘unbanked’.\n\nNadiem added, “At Gojek, it’s always about tackling challenges and enabling a\nbetter life for everyone in our ecosystem. From enabling cashless transactions\nfor consumers to ease of payments and business growth for merchants, GoPay has\nproven that #ThereIsAlwaysAWay to change the world for the better.”\n\nGoPay CEO Aldi Haryopratomo also expressed his gratitude for the trust placed in\nGoPay, “We have always focused on the grassroots. Since 2016, GoPay has quickly\ntransformed from a simple way for users to pay for Gojek services to driver\npartners now being able to use our platform to access mortgages, loans for\neducation, health insurance, and even save for Umrah. Today, GoPay is the\nlargest consumer digital payments platform in Indonesia and more than 90% of our\nGoPay merchants are micro, small, and medium enterprises. However, we do not\njust measure success in terms of current transaction volumes, but rather by how\nwe can create grassroots impact at a global scale.”\n\nNote: A merchant who uses GoPay to develop her business. As the biggest digital\npayments platform in Indonesia, GoPay not only eases payment transactions, but\nalso bridges driver partners and merchants to access various financial services\nsuch as KPR subsidies, education savings, health insurance, and Umrah savings.In\nits fifth year running, Fortune’s “Change the World” list is intended to\nshowcase the synergy between business strategy and the creation of positive\nsocial impact.\n\nThe assessment of nominees is conducted in partnership with the Shared Value\nInitiative, a global platform for organizations seeking business solutions to\nsocial challenges, and FSG, a non-profit social-impact consulting firm.\nFortune’s decision making on this award is based on four criteria: Measurable\nsocial impact, Business results, Degree of innovation, and Corporate\nIntegration.\n\n“GoPay’s strategy is to build an ecosystem with our partners. We believe that by\nincluding more people in the formal financial system, we can grow together with\nour partners which include banks, restaurants, retailers, and many more.\n\nMuch like a coral reef where the more coral and fish enhance the vibrancy of the\necosystem, we believe that the more partners we have, the more families we can\nhelp,” Aldi concluded.\n\nAbout Gojek Group\n\nGojek is a Super App. It’s one app for ordering food, commuting, digital\npayments, shopping, hyper-local delivery, getting a massage and two dozen\nservices. It is Indonesia’s first and fastest growing unicorn building an\non-demand empire across Southeast Asia.\n\nAs of 2018, Gojek processed more than $9 billion annualized gross transaction\nvalue (GTV) across all markets where it operates — in Singapore, Thailand and\nVietnam. The Gojek app was launched in 2015, and is now the largest consumer\ntransactional technology group on a GTV-basis in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe Gojek app is available for iOS and Android.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor media queries, contact apoorva.babu@go-jek.com.","html":"<p>By Apoorva Babu</p><p>Gojek, Southeast Asia’s leading on-demand technology platform, once again made it to the annual Fortune <a href=\"https://fortune.com/change-the-world/2019\" rel=\"noopener\">‘Change the World’ list</a>.
