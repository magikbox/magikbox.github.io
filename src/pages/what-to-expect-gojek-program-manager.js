                  We’re excited you’re coming to interview at Gojek! Your visit
                  will give you an opportunity to meet some more of our team and
                  get a feel for what it’s like to work here. We’ve put together
                  this short guide to give you an idea of what your day will
                  involve. Like many things at a fast-growing startup, we’re
                  constantly improving and iterating on how we interview, so if
                  you have any comments, concerns, or questions, please let us
                  know. We look forward to seeing you soon.

                  Many of the interviews included during your on-site visit are
                  designed to help us understand how you might approach common
                  scenarios encountered at Gojek. We’ve designed our case
                  studies to reflect the types of problems you may have to
                  solve, but the projects and topics are fictional. This is to
                  ensure that we evaluate you based on your Program Manager
                  skill-set and not based on your knowledge of Gojek. You’ll
                  always have the opportunity to ask us questions about anything
                  you don’t understand.

                        discussions where you work through problems with the

                        to evaluate how you solve problems and collaborate with
                        teammates, rather than your Gojek expertise.

                        Consider what's important to you in a job, what you'd
                        like to see in a work environment, how you partner with
                        colleagues and managers, and what you'd like to avoid.
                        Feel free to ask about company goals, team organization,
                        Gojek’s values, etc

                      <li>
                        Take some time to review the job description and think
                        of how your past experience relates to this role. You
                        might find it useful to come up with a few flexible
                        examples of projects you've worked on in the past.
                        Examples of past experience and work often come up
                        during interview conversations, and often it's easiest
                        to draw upon a few vetted examples instead of coming up
                        with something on the spot! (Please don’t discuss
                        anything that your previous or current employers would
                        consider confidential).

                        Be well-rested and ready to think on your feet, as some
                        of the interviews will require you to problem-solve in
                        real time.
