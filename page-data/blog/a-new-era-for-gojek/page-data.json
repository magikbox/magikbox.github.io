Nadiem, Andre and Kevin have been\nrunning the business together for a number of years, which will ensure that this\nleadership transition will run smoothly.\n\nNadiem’s news was communicated in an email to all Gojek staff that was sent\ntoday. In the email, he looked back on how the company has grown over the past\nnine years and also set out his hopes for the future of the business:\n\n“We started this company with nothing, other than a deep desire to change things\nfor the better. We saw that the streets of Jakarta were a mess and that there\nwas an informal community of ojek drivers who could easily act as a huge part of\nthe solution to that mess, if only they were organised and working efficiently.\n\n“With just that initial desire to improve life for everyone, as well as a large\namount of support from countless friends, partners and stakeholders, we’ve\ncreated Gojek. An iconic company that flies the flag for the future of Indonesia\nand Southeast Asia.\n\n“I will leave Gojek in the capable hands of Andre Soelistyo and Kevin Aluwi as\nco-CEOs, both of whom have played central roles in moving the company along its\npath from that office in South Jakarta onto the global stage.\n\n“We got very lucky as we progressed along that path, but I believe that luck in\nbusiness only really becomes a valuable commodity if you have the brilliant\nminds needed to take advantage of it. Kevin and Andre have mentored me to be the\nleader I am today. They are quite simply Gojek’s best. They have been running\nthis company for a number of years and I have complete faith not just in their\ntechnical skills and ability to execute flawlessly, but also in their integrity\nand their desire to do the right thing every step of the way.\n\n“High emotions are involved in running a company like Gojek but Andre and Kevin\nare always the steady voices of reason, approaching problems with intelligence\nand compassion. I couldn’t ask for better successors as the Gojek movement\nbegins its next stage of growth.”\n\nA joint statement released by Andre and Kevin said: “When a friend and mentor\nleaves a business you have built together, there is always going to be some\nsadness, but we are both determined that Gojek will go from strength to\nstrength. We will continue to implement our vision as we focus on what the Gojek\nof the next ten years is going to be like.\n\n“This company has changed the lives of so many people in Indonesia and around\nthe region, and our key priority is to ensure that we can continue to act as a\npositive force in society for the foreseeable future.”\n\nUnder Andre and Kevin’s management, Gojek has grown exponentially, to process\nover two billion transactions a year. The company’s fundraising efforts have\nattracted some of the world’s most exciting companies including Google, Tencent,\nMitsubishi, Visa, AIA and Astra, with Series F set to raise well over US$2bn.\nThe company has also launched operations in Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam,\nwhile the Gojek app has become the most-used on-demand application in Indonesia,\nwhere its food and payments businesses have overtaken transport to become the\nlargest businesses within the group.\n\nWith the new structure, Andre will focus on corporate functions and management\nof capital allocation, international expansion as well as the payments and\nfinancial services businesses, while Kevin will focus on the product development\nelements of the Gojek business as well as marketing, organisational development\nand the transportation and food delivery businesses.\n\nSince co-founding Gojek, Kevin has held significant leadership roles across\nproduct and functional teams within the organisation. He has used his background\nin Business Intelligence to pioneer the use of data for decision-making across\nthe Gojek business. He has also assembled deep technology expertise across the\ndata, engineering and product teams, with a focus on enhancing the platform’s\noverall user experience. Prior to his role at Gojek, Kevin spent time at Zalora\nIndonesia, Merah Putih Incubator and Salem Partners.\n\nSimilarly, Andre has played a pivotal role in laying a solid foundation for\nGojek’s rapid growth. He has overseen over US$4bn of fundraising, which\nattracted key investors such as Google, Tencent, Astra, KKR and Warburg Pincus.\nHe has also laid the foundation for the company’s business strategy for long\nterm sustainability. Prior to joining Gojek, Andre was an Executive Director at\nNorthstar Group — Indonesia’s largest private equity fund, and was previously\nthe Head of Corporate Finance at Delta Dunia Makmur.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLeading the next phase of Gojek — a statement from Gojek Co-CEOs, Kevin Aluwi\nand Andre Soelistyo\nGojek’s new co-CEOs Kevin Aluwi and Andre Soelistyo have today released a\nstatement following the announcement that Founder Nadiem Makarim has accepted a\nposition in President Joko Widodo’s new cabinet.\n\nAndre and Kevin have been running the business along with Nadiem, for a number\nof years, which will ensure a smooth leadership transition.

We now have over two million driver\npartners across Southeast Asia and over 500,000 merchants, all of whom together\nprocess over two billion transactions annually.\n\n“Both of us have been running the Gojek business alongside Nadiem for some time,\nso there will be no disruption to the day to day operations or the amazing\ngrowth we have enjoyed over the years. Andre will focus on corporate functions\nand management of capital allocation, international expansion as well as\npayments and financial services, while Kevin will focus on the product\ndevelopment elements of the Gojek business as well as marketing, organisational\ndevelopment and the transportation and food delivery businesses.\n\n“We are well prepared for the future and this is due in large part to the many\noutstanding industry leaders that have joined us over the past few years, and\nthe collective vision and execution of the entire Gojek team.\n\n“We would like to conclude by thanking the government of Indonesia for\nrecognising the significance our business has had on society. We will respect\nthe process the Palace has set out by not going into too much detail before\ntomorrow’s inauguration.
